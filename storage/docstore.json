January 24, 2020. \nA month after forming an exploratory committee, former Maryland Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah will announce today that he will run for Mayor of Baltimore as a Democrat this year.  \nVignarajah will hold a press conference outside City Hall at 11 a.m. today to announce his decision, explain how this race will be different from the past, and focus on several signature issues \u2014 including free college, reducing property taxes, and Harborplace \u2014 that he intends to put front and center during the campaign.  \nVignarajah will be joined by a number of community members who have urged him to run who are among the hundreds he has fought for over the past few years, including victims of tax sales, families of murder victims, and the residents who successfully stopped BGE.  \n### \n\nPRESS RELEASE \nVignarajah to Stand with Fells Point Business Owner as City Orders Parklet Removal \nBALTIMORE. January 30, 2024. \nJust as he did three years ago when the Mayor shut down outdoor seating just days after he took office, Democratic mayoral candidate and former Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah will stand with the owner and staff of Abbey Burger Bistro, a beloved Fells Point restaurant, as they dismantle their outdoor seating to avoid an irrational fine threatened by the City \u2014 even as City Hall allows most other restaurants to keep their parklets and outdoor seating. \nMarigot Miller, the owner of a restaurant that has two additional city locations, will explain how bizarre the City\u2019s process has been. She will ask why the rules are being changed every few weeks, why her store has been singled out, and how the incompetence and unresponsiveness of City Hall is destroying small businesses, not just in Fells Point but across Baltimore.  \nThe press conference will take place at the Abbey Burger location in Fells Point (811 S. Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21231) at 1:15 p.m. Ms. Miller will make remarks and take questions, and the staff will be actively working to remove the parklet around that time.  \n### \n\nMAYORAL CANDIDATE PLEDGES TO END PAY-TO-PLAY PROCUREMENT \nBALTIMORE. January 31, 2024. \nToday, at 11 AM, in front of City Hall, Democratic mayoral candidate and former Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah will unveil his promise to end corruption in city contracting.  \nVignarajah will pledge to (1) forbid campaign donors from bidding on city procurement contracts; (2) empower the Inspector General to pursue criminal remedies for flagrant violations; (3) require firms participating in city procurement to disclose possible conflicts of interest; and (4) form an independent Citizen Advisory Group that would review all city contracts over $100,000 and make recommendations to the Board of Estimates and the public.\nToday\u2019s commitment comes a week after the Baltimore Brew reported that, to redesign its website, the City has now approved giving $2.2 million to the deputy mayor\u2019s husband, who donated to the Mayor Brandon Scott\u2019s reelection campaign and whose downtown venue hosted the Mayor\u2019s reelection fundraiser in October; the deputy mayor changed her ethics statement to disclose her husband\u2019s contract after news broke about the no-bid contracts awarded to the Mayor\u2019s donor.  \nLast week\u2019s news is an echo of times when former Mayor Sheila Dixon repeatedly voted to award IT contracts to her sister\u2019s employer, a company with no office whose CEO eventually pled guilty to falsifying tax returns; Dixon failed to disclose her sister\u2019s employment and falsely denied voting on those contracts to her sister\u2019s company.  \n### \n\nPRESS RELEASE \nVignarajah Pledges to Block Luxury Apartments on Inner Harbor Public Promenade \nBALTIMORE.

February 6, 2024. \nYet another city politician convicted of a crime of greed is a dark day for Baltimore and no cause for celebration. Truth is, Marilyn Mosby follows in an embarrassing tradition set by former Mayors and other public officials who have operated as though they are above the law. We know Baltimore has better stories than this to tell to the world. \nLet no one forget Ms. Mosby is a mother and daughter, and even those who disagree with her, indeed even those of us who have run against her, should find no joy in her fall. Justice has been done. May she and her children now have the same respect and privacy we would seek as they process and prepare for what comes next and as they find comfort in the promise of redemption and grace. \n#  #  # \n\nPRESS RELEASE \nVignarajah Formally Files to Enter Race for Mayor \nBALTIMORE.

He will also stress why the election debate so far between which is the lesser of two evils, corruption or incompetence, is not a debate worthy of Baltimore.  \nFinally, Vignarajah, a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Stephen G. Breyer and federal prosecutor in Maryland, will comment on yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court argument and the Special Counsel\u2019s commendable decision not to bring charges against President Joe Biden.  \n#  #  # \n\nVIGNARAJAH DEMANDS FORENSIC AUDIT OF ARPA FUNDS \n\u201cThe Mayor has treated a once-in-a-century gift as a political slush fund.", "start_char_idx": 3651, "end_char_idx": 7884, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ddbc349-9335-4325-9be1-a3630ca37a83": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ddbc349-9335-4325-9be1-a3630ca37a83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/2024 Press Releases Combined (1.24.24 to 3.15.24).txt", "file_name": "2024 Press Releases Combined (1.24.24 to 3.15.24).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14970, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf2dfd3-8a5a-483c-ab7b-57717fbfdba2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/2024 Press Releases Combined (1.24.24 to 3.15.24).txt", "file_name": "2024 Press Releases Combined (1.24.24 to 3.15.24).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14970, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "8606958dc1dab0a4a8ff28e01b8fecb368f9a9638c1deab7fe89bbac108a62fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d9c999c-e0ba-4306-a544-13b54316a688", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/2024 Press Releases Combined (1.24.24 to 3.15.24).txt", "file_name": "2024 Press Releases Combined (1.24.24 to 3.15.24).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14970, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ddf0c50003fe197e6f67ede6b97ccd0b054452ad5a82defebf57c41de04fdc00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "434dbcb0-93d3-42f5-a020-de5bcd9aab1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6789ec8e8a59c70250feaac15e91438fe98cf03e18c0a55a0c87365cda66d2f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Vignarajah will emphasize several of his signature issues beyond fighting crime and corruption \u2014 free college, reducing property taxes, climate change, and Harborplace.

Squandering $641 million is the biggest, most unforgivable mistake of an administration that has become synonymous with incompetence.\u201d \nBALTIMORE. February 22, 2024. \nToday, at 12 PM, at 111 S. Calvert Street (19th Floor), Democratic mayoral candidate and former Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah will condemn the Mayor\u2019s total mismanagement of $641 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds\u2014that includes both the lack of timely and transparent spending as the City nears a critical federal deadline that, if missed, will cost Baltimore the remainder of the funds and the use of taxpayer dollars as a political slush fund to repay donors and developers and curry favor with special interests.  \nThe public deserves to know more about this major expenditure, and the campaign is prepared to send in advance its presentation slides to all outlets that expect to attend the press conference or report on the issue. Please make that request directly to press@votethiru.com.  \nConcerned the public is oblivious to how hundreds of millions in federal funds are being spent, Vignarajah will lead a presentation that outlines (a) where the money is headed and how much still has to be spent; (b) the list of nonprofits that were selected (who knows how?) to receive funds; (c) examples of the Mayor repaying political favors and campaign donations; and (d) illustrations of what other cities did with their federal allotment.\n\u201cThe Mayor has frittered away a once-in-a-century opportunity, padding agency budgets, repaying favors to donors and developers, and feeding pet projects and special interests,\u201d said Vignarajah. \u201cSquandering $641 million is this Mayor\u2019s biggest, most unforgivable mistake.\u201d Here are a couple examples that will be discussed: \nMayor Scott gave $5 million to Seawall Development (Lexington Market) whose owners donated thousands in campaign contributions to the Mayor.\nMayor Scott gave $2 million to SEIU whose PAC has donated thousands to his campaigns.\nThis is the same Mayor who gave $2.2 million to the deputy mayor\u2019s husband, who donated to his reelection campaign and whose downtown venue hosted the Mayor\u2019s reelection fundraiser.  \nPerhaps the only thing that may be worse is not spending the money at all. Baltimore is at risk of that, since less than half the funds\u2014some $254 million\u2014have been formally committed, which means the City has only until December to obligate hundreds of millions more in federal funds.  \nAt the press conference, Vignarajah will make three demands of the Mayor: \nLaunch an independent forensic audit right now of how the funds are being spent.\nStop obligating funds in May 2024 in the event the Mayor loses the Democratic primary and allow the winner of the Democratic primary to convene a public commission to decide on how the remainder of the funds should be obligated, which could take place during a special session of the Board of Estimates in December after the next Mayor takes office and before the December 31 deadline.\nExplain publicly how allocations were made and by whom with a specific focus on how certain nonprofits and not others were chosen and why Lexington Market got $5 million.\nVignarajah will also make two pledges himself: \nAppoint a Special Counsel in first 30 days to investigate diversion and mismanagement of funds, referring misconduct for prosecution, reclaiming misspent or unspent funds for better use, and issuing a public report within 90 days.\nForbid campaign donors from applying for city procurement contracts except with respect to projects subject to blind competitive bidding.\n### \n\nVignarajah Unveils Strategy to Address Housing Crisis \nBALTIMORE.

The most affluent neighborhoods are becoming more and more dense, and the most disinvested communities are becoming more and more dangerous,\u201d said Vignarajah. \u201cThere is no question we need to commit resources, but we also need innovation, accountability, and a sense of urgency.

A free bus network could reduce commute times and make the city significantly more accessible. Atop the conversation of increased equity is increased ridership and its ability to boost city commerce. When Denver and Austin made transit fare-free, it resulted in an increase in ridership of 20-60% within the first few months. Improved ridership means fewer cars on the road and more foot traffic in commercial districts, which increases more street-level commerce. \nThe decision to kill the Red Line was not simply a transportation decision\u2014it prevented economic opportunities for tens of thousands of Baltimoreans. While I will do everything in my power to restart a Red Line 2.0 with the goal of completion by 2028, I will immediately start a free East to West, West to East bus system. Currently, our East to West avenues are dedicated to motor traffic\u2014in a city built for over a million with close to now only 600,000 residents, we can reimagine our transit grid and adopt innovative planning and policy using models from cities across the country and around the world as guidance.  \nPublic transit systems have been linked to lower rates of automobile accidents, which killed 511 people in Maryland last year. The US Department of Transportation found cars account for over 75% of transportation fatalities nationwide, while buses accounted for less than one percent of motor vehicle fatalities. \nEven as we push for safe public transit, we will also strive to improve safety features at bus stops and improve riders' experiences, including accurate maps with timetables so people know how long they're waiting, and bus shelters at every stop to make travel more feasible during inclement weather, particularly for the elderly and children. \nAs detailed further in Question 5, departing from an automobile-centric transit model for Baltimore will lead to significant health benefits for our residents. \n2. The fastest and most economical way to address climate change, improve public health, and create equal access to opportunity is to design a city that reduces dependence on private automobiles. What are the biggest barriers to getting people to choose walking, biking, or public transit instead of personal vehicles, and what would you do to address these impediments? \nAccess to transit is a massive hurdle for Baltimore residents. My administration will expand active transit options in the city by building bike lanes and promoting bike use. Some of these initiatives will take time and require a cultural shift; however, we will explore new and exisitng\u200b\t policies to breaking the status-quo such as expanding \u201cRide Your Bike to Work Day\u201d campaigns, pursuing tax incentives for commuting bicyclists to local businesses similar to those outlined in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018, and collaborating with organizations already doing great work to spur bike advocacy and ridership like Bikemore, B360, and the Baltimore Youth Kinetic Energy Collective.  \nIn the short term, we intend to expand e-scooter access. To ensure equitable distribution of scooters across the city, we will insert a requirement in new contracts that subsidized scooters be available at the same scale in transportation deserts as they are downtown. While we expand our public transit options, city-wide scooter access will be significant in addressing Baltimore\u2019s first and last mile transit issues. Companies that decide to enter the Baltimore market will be required to partner with City Hall to map where transit deserts are, and to ensure that the organic movement and replacement of scooters and bikes is equitable at the end of each day, as was required in the initial six month partnership with Lime and Bird. \nAs scooter populations boom, we need to work to keep the streets safer for riders and to hold scooter companies accountable when necessary.

To keep scooter companies accountable, we will push to include clauses in contracts guaranteeing that companies will be held solely responsible for retrieving vandalized or broken scooters, will repair scooters to ensure safety standards, and will be held liable for any injury caused by a malfunction in the scooter itself. \nRight now, the public transit options do not run reliable or efficiently. For buses, LocalLinks (low-frequency) buses are only on-time 68% of the time. Extrapolating that out, commuters have a 68% chance of being on time for work. High-frequency buses (CityLink) have a 73% chance of being on time which is still far less than ideal. The implementation of technology based monitoring including accurate, easily accessible timetables, and a user-friendly app will facilitate efficient operation and help increase ridership.  \n3. In 2017, the Planning Commission approved the Separated Bike Lane Network plan that connects 85% of Baltimore\u2019s neighborhoods by creating safe, protected places to ride a bike. Do you agree with the plan\u2019s recommendations, and if so, what would you do to ensure that we fulfill the plan\u2019s promise to build a minimum of 17 miles of bike lanes per year? Are there specific areas of the city where you would prioritize implementation? \nYes. I would leverage the existing \u2018Low Stress Streets\u2019 network to seamlessly integrate the Separated Bike Lane Network into our transit grid. \nI would follow the plan\u2019s proposal to create connection corridors over the next five years, but I would first direct the Planning Department to review the plan to ensure that the priority areas for are based on three identifiers: 1) places where low stress bicycle access can offset low car ownership, 2) areas that will provide residential access to transit lines that are presently dangerous or nonexistent, and 3) the size of the influence area based on the Planning Commission\u2019s approved plan.  \n4. Approximately 50 people are killed on city streets each year while walking, biking, or driving, with another 9,000 people injured. What is your plan to reduce the number of Baltimoreans injured and killed in traffic every year? \nAs Mayor, Baltimore will join the Vision Zero network of cities in the US committed to eliminating all traffic fatalities. The Department of Finance, Department of Planning, Department of Transportation, and Health Department will be brought together monthly to coordinate on transit developments regarding roadway design, speed management, and new technology that will influence our roads. We will establish a new default arterial speed limit and a default non-arterial speed limit, further enforcing the protection of bike lanes, bus lanes and our \u2018Block the Box\u2019 laws. \nWe will embrace Complete Streets redesign as a standard, and will provide enough resources for the Department of Transportation to actually implement it.  \nI also support implementing barrier-protected bike and walking paths, like The Big Jump that Bikemore advocated for on Druid Lake Park Drive, which make areas more accessible and safe for pedestrians, cyclists, and wheelchair users. \n5. Approximately 800 Baltimoreans die early every year from preventable diseases related to carbon emissions,more than double the city\u2019s murder rate. Thousands more are hospitalized each year as these emissions trigger asthma and other respiratory diseases. \nThere is a strong correlation between hospitalization and proximity to major car commuter routes. What is your plan to reduce carbon emissions from automobiles in order to decrease the number of Baltimoreans hurt by and dying from emissions-related diseases? \nI plan to invest in transit expansion in a sustainable, environmentally-conscious manner.

As discussed, I intend to repurpose one of the avenues exclusively for public and green transportation.  \nShifting the city\u2019s focus away from an automobile-centric model has clear health benefits from decreased emissions. In their study, EXHALE, the CDC demonstrated that public transportation systems can reduce the amount of air pollution from motor vehicles by taking cars off the road. For every passenger mile traveled, buses produce only five percent as much carbon monoxide, less than 8% as many volatile organic compounds, and nearly half as much CO2 and nitrogen oxides as cars. \nUtilizers of public transit will also receive the added benefits of being more likely to experience physical activity throughout the day\u2014anywhere from 8 to 33 minutes of walking daily\u2014improving cardiovascular health. Studies from the American Public Transportation Association have found that the cleaner air and lifestyle that comes with improving rapid transit services translate to per capita annual health benefits of $355. \nWe will provide free East-West busses, bike lanes, and pedestrian passages along this avenue. The elimination of cars from this passage would improve the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians by simply reducing the volume of traffic. The concentrated motor traffic on the remaining avenues would likely result in increased travel time. The free and green transit options would see a corresponding increase in popularity as the faster and cheaper option causing a natural reduction in motor transportation and air pollution\u2014all of which will be paid for by the increase in revenues from increased employment. My vision is that we quickly demonstrate demand for East-West transit to restart the Red Line 2.0 and then expand the free bus lines to the major arteries criss crossing the city.  \n6. Do you walk for transportation? If so, for what purposes, how often, and what was your last trip walking? \nI walk in and around the Federal Hill neighborhood to meet friends, for breakfasts and dinners, and to run errands. I only walk for commuting when I work out of my law firm\u2019s downtown office. I commute by car when working out of the firm\u2019s Mount Washington office. And of course, during the span of the political campaign I have walked neighborhoods all across Baltimore as part of our campaign\u2019s expansive door-knocking efforts. Just this past weekend, we spent the day walking all through Waverly and Ednor Gardens.  \n7. Do you use public transportation? If so, for what purposes, how often, and what was your last trip by public transportation? \nI use public transit infrequently in Baltimore. Most recently, I have used the Circulator to and from the downtown area. \nBaltimore\u2019s inadequate transit grid is only highlighted because of my time living elsewhere. When I lived in New York City, I did not have and did not need a car because I relied on a functional transit system every day for work and personal purposes. When I lived in London, I did not have and did not need a car because London, like many other European cities, has a highly functional public transit system, and walking and biking is an integrated part of the culture. There are clear models that can dramatically reduce our reliance on personal vehicles and increase our commitment to public transportation, but these models require a comprehensive plan and investment in infrastructure. As Mayor, moving towards a modern, functional, environmentally-conscious public transit grid will be a top priority.  \nDo you ever ride a bicycle? Is it for transportation, recreation, or both? What was your last trip by bicycle? \nNot since living in London have I relied on biking for daily transportation. Cycling, however, has been a form of recreation for me since I was a little kid. Because of my current schedule, it is a less regular part of my life now, but it remains a valued form of recreation periodically on weekends.  \nBaltimore\u2019s urban areas have limited space on streets.

Agree \nMinimum parking requirements are shown to increase housing costs while limiting potential density and making neighborhoods less walkable. I support following the lead of other cities that have removed minimum parking requirements from new development. \n \n[skip], comment: This determination must be made on a case by case basis \nSome cities require employers that subsidize parking also offer an option for employees to receive that subsidy as a cash payment. I support a mandate that employers offer parking cash- out so that employees can choose to pocket that money, use it for alternative transportation, or continue using that cash to pay for parking. \n[skip], comment: Employers should provide public transit subsidies alongside any efforts to subsidize parking. \nIncreasing density in areas of opportunity is proven to help individuals escape poverty. \nI support taller, denser, or larger buildings in areas that are now prohibited by zoning. Skip, comment: This too should be decided on a case by case basis. \nTransit oriented development can expand access to areas of opportunity by locating housing and retail along high frequency transit. Current zoning code only identifies these zones along subway and lightrail routes. I support expanded Transit Oriented \nDevelopment zoning to include areas within a quarter mile of high-frequency bus routes. \nAgree, Charlotte provides an instructive example of why the increased economic activity and\u200b\t positive outcomes in low-income neighborhoods warrants the change. \nIt is now widely accepted that Single Family Residential Zoning was historically created to maintain racial segregation. I support removing Single Family Residential Zoning categories, allowing both single family and multi family residences to be built in all residential zoning areas. \n[Skip]\u200b\t \nI support allowing existing residences to be split into apartments in all zoning categories without having to pass legislation for each conversion, increasing density in neighborhoods that were traditionally single family homes. \n \nAgree Provided that the additional units are high-quality affordable housing options passing all\u200b\t necessary safety regulations.  \nAt 20mph, 90% of pedestrians survive being hit by a car. At 40mph, only 10% survive. I support enforcing a maximum speed limit of 25 mph on arterial streets, and 20 mph on local streets. \nDisagree, However, as Mayor, I will direct the DoT to work with community groups to determine appropriate speed limits for our major arterial streets and local streets. \nAllowing turns on red is a contributing factor in increased pedestrian injury and death. \nI support banning turns on red at all intersections that allow pedestrian crossing. \nDisagree \nAutomated Speed and Red Light Enforcement Cameras are widely proven to reduce fatal collisions. I support using these cameras on any street, not just near schools and construction sites. \nDisagree - These red light camera programs tend to disadvantage low-income neighborhoods.  \nThe Automated Speed Enforcement Camera current threshold is 12 miles per hour.

Agree \nThe city adopted the Greenway Trails Network plan that will connect existing trails such as Gwynns Falls Trail and Herring Run Trail to create a 35-mile trail loop that connects 80% of Baltimore\u2019s neighborhoods to greenspace and recreational trails. I support the construction of these trail connections, even if it requires using grass medians or taking road space or parking space away from private automobiles. \nAgree", "start_char_idx": 15950, "end_char_idx": 17399, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b48a0346-6c01-43c2-849e-b6dcb3260a2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b48a0346-6c01-43c2-849e-b6dcb3260a2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e10b9f4b-0200-4356-be02-3618eb3d91c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e70081a2723030a4ed8ef237a5b454786f7e50d1d00a58a21462a989cdc801ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f558234b-4c1f-420c-a87f-d66e210dce90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Bikemore Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "Bikemore Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "8208eb4d0c9ad167237ab1c980787152e3e0b2906b99d7771880cc40956202c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "631de372-698b-4eaf-87fc-78319fdd57d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6a5e42e075e93c1ace71836a1c21cf8abc8dd1dfe4ee5939891cf2f6c78a2dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thiru\u2019s \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan sets forth a comprehensive strategy that goes beyond the platitudes and empty prescriptions that have been recycled and repackaged for decades.

ultimate goal of adding 10,000 ground cameras to the city\u2019s private camera network.\nClear the Backlog of Burglary Evidence\nFor the first time, Baltimore will use private grant funding to clear

with BPD, as well as other law enforcement agencies, to keep open or reopen murder investigations involving high-caliber weaponry, 10 or more casings, and headshots.\nAnonymous Monitoring of Juvenile Cases\nFor the first time, Baltimore will facilitate anonymized monitoring of juvenile cases, so the public can better track outcomes in violent crime cases involving juvenile offenders.\nNon-Public

It ravages neighborhoods, drives families out of the city, deters business investment, and destroys the lives of too many of Baltimore\u2019s sons and daughters. The next Mayor\u2019s top focus must be to end the bloodshed.\n\nThiru\u2019s \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan sets forth a comprehensive, detailed, and actionable strategy that goes beyond the platitudes and empty prescriptions that have been recycled and repackaged for decades. It accounts for the current deficit in police officers and the constraints of the federal consent decree; it builds on the crime reduction plans set forth by others, including that of Commissioner Michael Harrison, which is understandably focused on changing culture, rebuilding basic department infrastructure, and improving patrol operations in high-crime areas; it reckons with the reality of prosecuting cases in Baltimore City where juries respond best to cases where police and eyewitness testimony is corroborated by forensic evidence and camera footage; it creates two new positions in City Hall and promises a monthly ComStat open to the public; it brings accountability and transparency principles featured in adult prosecutions to the juvenile justice system; it establishes and expands specific cost-effective diversion and reentry initiatives; and it takes seriously a citywide commitment to reconceive crime in Baltimore as a public health crisis in need of acute interventions as well as systemic solutions.\nIt accomplishes all of this while pledging a leaner police budget, prescribing a timetable for action, and presenting clear metrics of success.\nThiru and his team took note of the various crime plans that have been released over the years, all of which recite similar themes and typically lack the kind of detail the public needs to gauge whether a plan is viable.", "start_char_idx": 3347, "end_char_idx": 8222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9082d016-d7dd-4816-8e58-d47846a609c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9082d016-d7dd-4816-8e58-d47846a609c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e10b9f4b-0200-4356-be02-3618eb3d91c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e70081a2723030a4ed8ef237a5b454786f7e50d1d00a58a21462a989cdc801ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "631de372-698b-4eaf-87fc-78319fdd57d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02a139d2bf330862891b3ff18fb823ca8772ccc0a917ca342d607c55aba9c730", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1fa005f-5a9e-431e-87be-3bc80b423c93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f19196962a445f3b56e033a97f1de1786105237b51e0078911fdf903046c00f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It accomplishes all of this while pledging a leaner police budget, prescribing a timetable for action, and presenting clear metrics of success.\nThiru and his team took note of the various crime plans that have been released over the years, all of which recite similar themes and typically lack the kind of detail the public needs to gauge whether a plan is viable.

accountability and greater transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know gun violence is driven by a small number of identifiable repeat offenders, typically members of gangs, who ravage essentially the same neighborhoods year after year. Because of this, dramatically reducing gun violence does not require mass incarceration, zero tolerance, or cash bail. What is needed is relentless focus on the deadliest neighborhoods, deadliest criminals, and deadliest crimes. City Hall has failed to deliver that focus and, as a result, has failed to deliver justice to countless Baltimore families.\nAs Mayor, Thiru will drive down the number of murders to below 200 within three years. This will not happen by accident. It will happen because city leaders will develop a battle plan and execute it. Here are the cornerstones of Thiru\u2019s plan to end the bloodshed.\n\nLaunch simultaneous wiretap investigations in the City\u2019s 12 deadliest neighborhoods with coordinated arrests before the killing months of summer.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 26% of all murders occurred in 12 neighborhoods. Because these consistently high murder rates are fueled by gangs feuding over consistently profitable drug territory, wiretap investigations are a potent, proven method of shutting down the violence.\n\nTHIS DATA NEEDS TO BE UPDATED;  AT THIS MOMENT DATA IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM MAY 20th 2019 through all of 2020\nThese surgical investigations do not require police to clear corners or pursue the irresponsible stop-and-frisk policies that have characterized discriminatory approaches of the past. Instead, law enforcement should develop intelligence to identify the shooters, killers, and leaders in each of these 12 neighborhoods, launch wiretap investigations using undercovers and forensic technology, and after a thorough investigation, extract the violent organization, root and branch.\n\nWe know this strategy can work.\n\nIn November 2013, police and prosecutors, under Thiru\u2019s leadership, brought a first- of-its-kind gang prosecution to a neighborhood that had endured nearly a murder or shooting every month for five years. For 18 months, that same neighborhood didn\u2019t see a single murder. Not one. That strategy did not displace violence; it eliminated it.\n\n\n\n\nA similar strategy was deployed in Cherry Hill, where federal and local prosecutors conducted a collaborative gang investigation.

NEEDS UPDATE FROM SPECIFIC SOURCE\nIt is important to emphasize that these investigations do not require hundreds of officers nor do they end in thousands of arrests. In fact, these proactive investigations are best done with a small, experienced platoon of city officers and federal agents led by one or two federal and local prosecutors. The \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan calls for intel workups to begin shortly after the Democratic primary (May 2024), the wiretap investigations to begin that winter (November-December 2024), with arrests just before the summer (April 2025). Rather than initiate a case or create a new initiative in response to a summer of violence, this strategy is designed to anticipate and prevent the violence just before, if history is a guide, it is set to surge.\n\nUPDATED FIGURE\nThe law enforcement intervention cannot be the end of the work in these neighborhoods. Rather than pushing the violence to neighboring areas, which is what traditional patrol-focused strategies tend to do, extracting the gang will bring about a period of real peace but it will also create a vacuum. New gangs and violent drug organizations cannot be allowed to fill the void. Rather, we must bring to bear a coordinated array of resources and support organizations from Safe Streets and Ceasefire (focused on the violence) to ROCA and LEAD (focused on addiction) to a bevy of operators devoted to expunging records, workforce and housing development, lead abatement, job placement, mental health, and trauma.\n\nIdentify, investigate, and prosecute the worst violent offenders in each police district.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will also focus on identifying, investigating, and getting off the streets the worst violent repeat offenders in Baltimore. Each police district will use a combination of concrete metrics (prior convictions for violent crimes and gun offenses), along with on-the-ground intelligence to determine which criminals warrant greater investigative attention. A new Deputy Mayor for Public Safety will be responsible for coordinating interagency cooperation to ensure that responsible, rock solid cases are being built at local, state, and federal levels. BPD will be responsible for ensuring that resources are focused not on nuisance cases to drive public statistics, but rather on the individuals who are genuinely perpetrating violent crimes. This model of focused investigations mirrors the approach Thiru led when he was Chief of Major Investigations in Baltimore City. This initiative is all about execution and depends on strong leadership beginning with the Mayor and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety.\n\nLaunch specialized Cold Case initiative to focus on solving high-lethality murders.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will create the \u201cNever Forgotten\u201d Cold Case initiative in City Hall, which will work with BPD, as well as MSP and other law enforcement agencies, to ensure that law enforcement maintains investigative focus on murders involving high-caliber guns, 10+ casings at the crime scene, and headshots.

Clearance rates are not the percentages of murders that result in an arrest, because the Department includes in the overall count of cleared cases what it calls \u201cexceptional clearances,\u201d a term of art that refers to an investigation that cannot lead to an arrest (most often because the supposed suspect has himself been killed). Exceptional clearances have soared recently, which means an increasingly small number of murders actually end in an arrest.\n\n\n\u201cTo deter murders, we have to solve and prosecute more murders. Not on paper. But in real life.\nThis plan helps do just that.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor years, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) has been expected to effectively fight crime with a fraction of its full force. The Department once had as many as 3,300 officers. Before her resignation, Mayor Catherine Pugh estimated that BPD had 1,900 active officers, though it was authorized for 2,800 officers; this shortfall has crippled the City\u2019s ability to fight crime and generated massive overruns in overtime expenditures. Because of poor recordkeeping, estimates vary how many recruits are needed, but most agree the Department is hundreds of officers short.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2022, there was an overall loss of 1176 police officers, with 3,873 hires and 5,049 departures. The net loss from 2019 to 2022 alone is 329 officers. The loss of officers has not only made the city less safe, but has burdened taxpayers with soaring overtime costs. CHART NEEDS TO BE UPDATED\n\n\n\nEstimates vary as to the exact magnitude of the shortfall. There are no less than hundreds of budgeted positions that sit empty, though some claim we need more than a thousand more officers. Precise number aside, the bottom line is that the police department needs more police.\nThis deficit in personnel should not be seen as a problem, but rather, as an opportunity. BPD has a chance to rebuild a police force that looks and acts like the Department Baltimore deserves. In this respect, reconstituting the police force is not just about bringing in more officers \u2013 it's about bringing in the right officers and keeping them here. It\u2019s about training our officers to do the kind of effective, constitutional investigations that will restore community trust and get violent criminals out off the streets.\nAs Mayor, Thiru will drive a net increase of 600 police officers who are more diverse, less costly, and more effective than ever.\n\nRECRUIT, RETAIN, REVITALIZE", "start_char_idx": 20199, "end_char_idx": 23535, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d8581cb-6c04-4351-ba0d-f0382439da9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d8581cb-6c04-4351-ba0d-f0382439da9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e10b9f4b-0200-4356-be02-3618eb3d91c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e70081a2723030a4ed8ef237a5b454786f7e50d1d00a58a21462a989cdc801ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13c1c0fb-56b9-4dce-bdfe-ea4a768ece1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ae4bc575f030f0a29acd8ca4df07dc95ad820ff96bb447f8c428eb58fe88cdbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c262366c-b60f-4722-917b-1c8498b0337d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d49042f17f9d576d09a73587502b621d068502f387c48c0d62242b4c268b0e79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Estimates vary as to the exact magnitude of the shortfall.

We cannot wait decades for change. We must act now. Under Thiru\u2019s plan, we will produce a net increase of 600 active-duty police officers. Baltimore will recruit hundreds more officers, redeploy police to reflect the community\u2019s needs and priorities, and retrain officers who build stronger cases and better reflect constitutional policing in the next century. Police are not the sole answer to crime, but they have to be part of it. And the deficit of officers presents a rare chance to rebuild a Department that is more local, more professional, and more diverse, with more women, minorities, and immigrants.\nAs of 2022, only 16% of Baltimore\u2019s police force was female; nor is the police force as racially diverse as it needs to be. And the Justice Department has reported that, \u201croughly three-fourths of Baltimore PD officers live outside the Baltimore City limits.\u201d All of this must change. But change does not require strict rules or quotas. The Department must tailor its recruiting strategy to the types of officers it seeks to bring in, train, and keep.\nWe know a more diverse police force can drive lower crime and more just policing, and studies have shown that more women in a police department generates higher reporting of violent crimes against women including rape, domestic violence, and human trafficking. Here is where Thiru, as Mayor, will focus to recruit a new generation of police:\nRecruit heavily from local colleges, particularly HBCUs, with school-year and summer internships, senior-year cadet programs, and an emphasis on building the kind of community-based police force we can all be proud of.\n\nThere is plenty of local talent at our local colleges and universities. In 2015, 567 graduates of Baltimore City high schools went off to attend 13 colleges in the Baltimore area. They are now seniors looking for a job, and many of them are Baltimore natives looking to come home. As Mayor, Thiru will implement a recruiting initiative that does for the policing in Baltimore what Teach for America did for teaching across the country. Instead of a cadet program that focuses solely on high school students who are several years away from being eligible to enroll as officers, an expanded cadet program would have a dozen openings at each local college and university for seniors who would be placed on the fast-track into the Department. Semester and summer internships even\n\nearlier in college would expose students to the critical work police are doing in Baltimore and to the senior cadet initiative for college seniors.\n\nBy making local college students feel they are part of the solution when it comes to perceived problems with policing in America, we can set up clear pathways to well-paying positions with stable benefits and career advancement opportunities. This is a guaranteed renewable source of motivated young professionals who could quickly replenish the foundation of the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nRemove recruitment impediments by lifting marijuana restrictions, prioritizing mental fitness assessments over physical fitness tests, and allowing immigrants to serve.\n\nThe department should focus more on psychological evaluations and reevaluate physical fitness tests, an outmoded hurdle that results in far fewer female officers. Also, neither permanent-resident immigrants nor anyone who has smoked marijuana in the last three years can currently apply to be a Baltimore City police officer. These are arbitrary restrictions that mean young, diverse applicants from Baltimore can go to law school and medical school or serve in the U.S. Army but cannot apply for a job with the BPD. As Mayor, Thiru will push to remove these senseless obstacles and get worthy, otherwise qualified applicants immediately into the pipeline.\n\nWe know it is harder to recruit police today than in years past. We also know that applications in Baltimore tripled overnight once the Department put the application online\u2014which only happened last summer. If we recruit an average of just 10 new officers from each local college, we are already contributing more than 100 additional police each year, on top of our current efforts. In three years, this alone would dramatically cut the personnel deficit\u2014and it would create the kind of diverse, local, and professional police force Baltimore residents deserve.

In light of current police shortages, we must seek to redeploy police officers and get short-term assistance from partner agencies. As Mayor, Thiru would pursue several strategies:\n\nRedeploy school police to assist with patrol in neighborhoods around assigned schools.\n\nBaltimore is the sole jurisdiction in Maryland with a sworn school police force. While the debate about the advantages and drawbacks of school police continues, there is little question these 90 well-trained officers could perform a valuable patrol function in the neighborhoods around their schools. School officers are permitted to carry firearms when they patrol outside of the facility but must store them in a secure location during school hours. Put simply, right now, we need more teachers and social workers inside schools and more police on the streets. That\u2019s where Thiru, as Mayor, would redeploy them.\n\nReestablish role of Sheriff\u2019s Office in warrant apprehension and community policing.\n\nThe \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan requires every available detective to work violent crime investigations. Increasing patrol at the expense of detective work in the name of community policing is a short-sighted strategy. But, to be sure, community policing is vital to Baltimore City. This is a role that the Sheriff\u2019s Office is perfect to play. Dozens of Baltimore sheriffs could assist with community policing, building relationships in the neighborhoods and assisting with local events. This would reinforce the strong reputation sheriffs enjoy in the community and would free up detectives from working mandatory overtime patrol shifts while carjacking, shooting, and murder investigations languish.\n\nAccelerate civilianization of the police force.\n\nBPD has begun to recruit more civilian personnel but has yet to move sworn officers out of civilian roles and back onto the streets where they are most needed. Within 100 days, the Department will identify all sworn officers working in positions where civilian employees would be appropriate. Within six months, those officers would be assigned to patrol and detective units, allowing incoming civilian personnel to backfill those spots.\n\nUtilize private police to reduce costs for business district and special event deployments.\n\nVeteran detectives who have been reassigned to address patrol deficits need to return to detective work. Patrol shortages can be mitigated by relying, in the short term, on private police who can handle shifts that are currently exacerbating overtime expenditures.\n\n\nRetrain. Building a police force for the next generation of BPD is not just about hiring new and younger officers. It also requires the Department to better train officers to police a diverse urban population with soaring crime and unprecedented mistrust in police.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will require BPD to develop and institute cutting-edge training modules for cadets and in-service training for veteran officers to better prepare them with respect to de-escalation strategies, crisis response, trauma and mental health, implicit bias, youth-interaction, best practices for body-worn cameras, community policing, and more. Preparing officers for next-generation policing will also require next-generation teaching methods. For implicit bias, for example, Prince George\u2019s County began using virtual reality tools in 2018, tools that Researchers at the University of Maryland found to be a low-cost option for health care professionals, engineers, and technicians. Existing training also needs to be updated with new insights. For instance, police will need to be trained to change the presumption from \u201coff\u201d to \u201con\u201d for body-worn cameras, so that citizens do not interpret activation of body cameras as an escalation in the encounter.\n\n\n\nTo end the bloodshed in Baltimore, we must break the pernicious cycle of poverty, crime, and prison. An estimated 73% of those individuals released from prison who return to Baltimore City are rearrested and reincarcerated within three years. This is a literal revolving door. As Mayor, Thiru would break this pattern at four separate points.\n\nFor the 80-100 most at-risk individuals scheduled for release to Baltimore City each month, develop a customized reentry plan for those returning citizens a full year in advance.\n\nPreparing for successful reentry cannot begin upon a person\u2019s return to society. It has to start much earlier. City Hall cannot assume this responsibility for all individuals returning from prison.

It has to start much earlier. City Hall cannot assume this responsibility for all individuals returning from prison. But, for those at greatest risk of being killed or killing someone else, the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety will work with DPSCS to ensure that a comprehensive reentry strategy is in place one year before the inmate\u2019s scheduled release. This plan will address skills deficits, trauma and addiction, and housing challenges; it will develop a plan for where the inmate will live, work, and sleep, to whom that person will report, and on whom that person can rely for support. It will impose strict conditions of release so that their progress can be monitored and assessed. The aspiration cannot be to expect everyone to turn their lives around immediately, but to reverse expectations so that instead of three out of four returning to prison, more than 75% move in the direction of a constructive, sustainable life.\n\nRemove structural impediments that prevent and discourage returning citizens from pursuing gainful, legal employment.\n\nFor many returning citizens, unpaid child support debt\u2014debt owed to the government that has already been paid to the spouse primarily responsible for the child\u2014carries consequences that make lawful employment highly unappealing. A returning citizen\u2019s driver\u2019s license can be suspended, and two-thirds of a person\u2019s reported income is garnished to service the unpaid debt. Under the current system, less than 2% of the overall debt is ever collected. Yet we maintain these draconian consequences, which only makes it more likely that a person returning from prison will return to illegal activities to\n\nmake money rather than take a job that, on paper, pays $12 an hour but, in reality, yields $4 an hour.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will establish smarter, more rational incentives, guaranteeing that one quarter of the debt is forgiven or repaid by the City after a returning citizen has maintained stable employment and stayed out of trouble for six months, one half at one year and the full amount at two years. The City would also work with the relevant state agencies to end the practice of suspending driver\u2019s licenses as a method of encouraging repayment of debt. It is counterproductive and wrong.\n\nLaunch the \u201cFaith in Justice\u201d reentry initiative to match returning citizens with 100 nonprofits and faith organizations who will each support five individuals returning to Baltimore.\n\nFederal laws like the Second Chance Act provide for federal grant money for reentry initiatives. As Mayor, Thiru will launch the \u201cFaith in Justice\u201d reentry initiative, securing $5,000,000 in federal grant money from the Second Chance Act, which will be dispersed to 100 nonprofits and faith organizations selected individually by 500 returning citizens to support their return to Baltimore. Because the nonprofit or faith organization is chosen by the returning citizen, there is no constitutional impediment to government money being provided to tax exempt religious institutions. At the same time, this would provide about\n$10,000 per returning citizen for the church or synagogue or nonprofit to allocate, in coordination with the individual, to best support his or her success. Participating organizations would be expected to maintain scrupulous records and assessments would be made annually, evaluating concrete metrics such as reported taxable income and the number of months of safe and stable housing.\n\nEstablish the \u201cCourt to Career\u201d adult diversion program and a parallel \u201cSchool to Success\u201d program for diverting juvenile offenders.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will ensure that City Hall takes responsibility for working with the courts to identify appropriate adult and juvenile candidates and establish partnerships with apprenticeship programs, workforce development initiatives, and welcoming business partners who together will provide a reliable pipeline for qualifying juveniles and individuals charged with low-level offenses to enter workforce development and job placement programs as a condition of their probation.\n\nThis initiative will ultimately divert 10,000 individuals each year from the revolving door of poverty, crime, and prison to a constructive path of skills training and job placement. Each year we charge tens of thousands in Baltimore with offenses ranging from drug possession to simple assault. To end the bloodshed, we have to bring to bear the resources we have and concentrate them on violent crime. Low-level offenses cannot be altogether ignored, but diverting thousands of these individuals and their cases to a more constructive path than incarceration will free up much-needed resources that are essential to combat and curb violence in Baltimore.", "start_char_idx": 32855, "end_char_idx": 37835, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e37d230c-38af-4379-b79d-93c3a810e52e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e37d230c-38af-4379-b79d-93c3a810e52e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e10b9f4b-0200-4356-be02-3618eb3d91c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e70081a2723030a4ed8ef237a5b454786f7e50d1d00a58a21462a989cdc801ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49409570-63e2-477e-bbdc-2e725f985faf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Crime Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48742, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "99686cbe3dc2e2990a8c6cb4def3377897f2c1d5de1bf8d9af26e1ba7e619030", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3dd7e3b-374d-46ef-9016-fb31b36a452e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db24ef76fc08cc5201bf9ad528358d01599ccaf33b2b040b5f906b89afe281ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As Mayor, Thiru will ensure that City Hall takes responsibility for working with the courts to identify appropriate adult and juvenile candidates and establish partnerships with apprenticeship programs, workforce development initiatives, and welcoming business partners who together will provide a reliable pipeline for qualifying juveniles and individuals charged with low-level offenses to enter workforce development and job placement programs as a condition of their probation.\n\nThis initiative will ultimately divert 10,000 individuals each year from the revolving door of poverty, crime, and prison to a constructive path of skills training and job placement.

Key features of these initiatives will be:\n\nOffering petty, non-violent offenders a permanent extinguishment of charges in exchange for the completion of an apprenticeship program that provides skills and training followed by specific job placement\n\nOffering qualifying juvenile offenders an opportunity to avoid a finding of delinquency if the individual, as a condition of a probationary period, pursues an apprenticeship and commences a paid employment opportunity of their choice\n\nSecuring $10 million in funding through public-private partnership, to expand the existing \u201cDistrict Court Reentry Project\u201d and ensure that there is a sufficient number of case workers, with a dozen being hired during the initiative\u2019s first year\n\nExtending employment alternatives by partnering with Baltimore employers who are committed to hiring ex-offenders that have devoted apprenticeship programs and opportunities for future employment\n\nThese public-private partnerships will invest $10+ million to expand and bring to scale the Baltimore City District Court Re-Entry Project (DCREP), a model program that currently receives virtually no support from City Hall or the City\n\nCouncil.

We need real investment in concrete programs that work.\u201d\n\n\n\nCLEAR THE FORENSIC BACKLOG\n\nLaw enforcement in Baltimore has to build stronger cases. City prosecutors are dropping too many prosecutions, pleading out felonies to unjustifiably lenient sentences, and losing over 80% of cases that go to trial. To help prosecutors succeed, particularly inexperienced ones, police officers must build stronger cases that will withstand the scrutiny of judges and juries.\n\nUnexamined forensic evidence presents one opportunity to strengthen cases. Baltimore has a massive backlog of untested rape kits and burglary crime scene evidence. As of 2022, the city had 991 untested rape kits. The current practice of not testing burglary crime scene evidence is also an enormous missed opportunity, since 40% of DNA and fingerprints from burglary crime scenes match a profile in the federal CODIS database.\n\nClearing these backlogs should be a priority. Current legislation already mandates that rape kits be tested in \u201ca timely manner,\" but forensic labs are often so inundated with evidence that they lack the capacity to test within a reasonable time frame. As Mayor, Thiru will secure and allocate resources to ensure the timely testing of rape kit and burglary crime scene evidence as part of the larger push to identify repeat and violent criminals.\n\nTesting the backlog of burglary crime evidence, given the high yield rate, would permit police and prosecutors to distinguish between, on the one hand, low-level offenders whose conduct is in the past and, on the other hand, repeat violent offenders who may be readily prosecuted for a burglary even if there is insufficient evidence to expect a shooting or murder prosecution.\n\nEXPAND THE GROUND AND AERIAL CAMERA NETWORK\n\nIn a city without the resources to consistently patrol every block and street corner, it is hard to protect homes and businesses from criminal activity. A rampant illegal drug trade and soaring gun violence have contributed to Baltimore\u2019s spot on America\u2019s most violent cities list. As a result, Baltimore\u2019s understaffed police department has\n\ntrouble devoting the requisite person-power to finding perpetrators of muggings, robberies, and fatal assaults.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s storeowners and landlords often keep surveillance cameras on their properties in order to help identify offenders, but these cameras have minimal storage and are not easily accessible.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will provide $100 rebates for all businesses and residences to install up-to-date, networked security cameras and to register them with BPD. In the event of a crime, police can request footage from the camera owners who can consent or decline. Some are already using home camera networks and working with police to solve crime in their neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition, Thiru has pledged to re-launch the aerial surveillance program, this time after public input and with specific restrictions to ensure its legality. While the last effort in 2016 to use the technology in was indefensible and likely unconstitutional, aerial surveillance is ultimately a potent tool to solve violent crimes. Investigators can follow captured pixels tied to a crime to determine where the subject came from and went. When the pixel passes a street camera at a particular time, police have an opportunity to get a closer look.

As we head toward recovery, our strategy must also account for the substantial impact and unique difficulties caused by the closing of schools and a statewide stay-at-home order. Finally, a visionary blueprint must aim to rebuild Baltimore with innovative strategies and propel it into the future as we reimagine our local economy around industries of the future.\n\n\u201cFrom Recovery to Prosperity\u201d is a three-phase roadmap across the relief, recovery, and rebuilding phases. Just as we rebuilt parts of Baltimore after the Great Fire a century ago, we have to address immediate needs over the next several months, seize opportunities for recovery in the following six- to 18-month period, and lay the groundwork for a five- and 10-year plan to reimagine a prosperous and inclusive economy.\n\nThis plan goes well beyond the limited proposals of other candidates who underestimate the challenges facing Baltimore and have proposed narrow solutions, limited largely to tapping into anticipated federal funding and dipping modestly into the city\u2019s financial reserves.

We need fiscal common sense that both prioritizes the immediate needs of our city and investments in our future, accounting for Baltimore\u2019s situation on the cusp of an exponential growth trajectory. Thiru has proposed a massive $250 million stimulus injection to promote spending and investment, and to support our most vulnerable individuals and communities.\n\nThe purpose of the Budget Stabilization Reserve, also called the \u201crainy day fund,\u201d is to provide a fiscal contingency plan that eases the effects of downturns. COVID-19 has triggered a dramatic downturn in our city that requires City Hall to support our community using the funds put aside for a moment exactly like this.\n\nWe have advocated for comprehensive financial audits to identify and subsequently address wasteful spending across City agencies. Correcting that inefficiency will more than offset the funds used from the Budget Stabilization Reserve so that we can expand and enhance needed critical care and services for vulnerable populations.\n\nBaltimore City boasts a stellar Aa2 and AA credit rating from Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor. Despite the strong full faith and credit of our City, we take a conservative approach to debt issuances and, therefore, make minor investments in infrastructure that serve as a band aid on a crumbling system. In this time of unprecedented need, it is critical that we tackle the gaping holes in our infrastructure and provide assistance and services to communities hit hardest by the crisis by using funds borrowed against our bond rating.\n\nWe propose immediately withdrawing $50 million from our rainy day fund and borrowing $200 million against our AA bond rating to (1) follow the lead of San Francisco and expand sick-leave payments, specifically for high-risk essential workers, (2) support small businesses by streamlining and temporarily waiving minor privilege fees and help locally-owned restaurants and hotels by extending the deadline for business invoices related to food and beverage taxes and hotel/motel taxes, (3) offer low-interest loans to small businesses in underserved areas and delay loan repayment, (4) ensure universal internet access, (5) accelerate road repair and construction projects, (6) install H-VAC systems and energy efficiency upgrades in all city schools, (7) launch a public and philanthropic donation fund to support first responders and their families, and (8) extend assistance to people experiencing homelessness in partnership with non-profit organizations.", "start_char_idx": 7827, "end_char_idx": 11828, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f5b9595-ed82-4d59-aa62-c51cb98b107b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f5b9595-ed82-4d59-aa62-c51cb98b107b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2123b828-8e80-4c19-a82f-7d212b6cd429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "70bd49f9f52c6725b4b182911d8c57979208862e34a92b14191458258ee22000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "449717b1-36a3-4b9e-941e-6df467f1f077", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e8f3e4fee4199a5b50a3d53a473f8df331e095b3ebc4da576ec76471ff5f5f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8177303d-6430-4c2d-98fc-4f4e1e7098eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8f89a5d6d546febe3462cdecdf078022596bb3e9dffb0bb1eab5aa02f12deea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Issue municipal bonds to build digital infrastructure, including fiber optics to ensure free, universal high-speed connectivity to bridge the digital divide, prioritizing students requiring educational access\n\nIn response to COVID-19, Governor Hogan made the unprecedented decision of closing schools indefinitely. Baltimore\u2019s students, who for a variety of reasons often fall behind state averages of achievement, are disproportionately affected by this deficit of instructional time. Even without a clear end to social distancing in sight, it is imperative that we find ways to keep students engaged in their studies. Many jurisdictions, even our neighboring counties, have decided to turn to virtual instruction. However, Baltimore City faces a \u201cdigital divide\u201d that leaves low-income communities and, disproportionately, communities of color without internet access or access to electronic devices conducive to learning. In 2018, the National Digital Inclusion Alliance ranked Baltimore the 60th worst- connected city in America, in a study of households without any broadband internet. It found that 21.96% of Baltimore households, or 52,084 families, lacked broadband internet access of any kind.\n\nTo bridge this divide and ensure equal access to online learning, we will designate funding to pay for the purchase and distribution of laptops and internet access to families. The city should also partner\n\nwith philanthropic and community organizations to set up a fund for lightly-used laptops that can be refurbished and distributed to families in need. The Digital Harbor Foundation, for example, recently partnered with the Baltimore Robotics Program to provide free community Wi-Fi in southwest Baltimore. City Hall should fund initiatives like theirs while propelling them to a larger, citywide scale.\n\nCity Hall should also partner with broadband internet providers to offer free or significantly reduced- priced essential services to low-income households without access.\n\nThiru will ensure universal internet access across the city to not only educate our children in this time of virtual learning, but also ensure that adults have the resources to apply for jobs and play their bills in an era of unprecedented economic uncertainty.\n\n\nAccelerate road repair and construction projects at lower costs and less inconvenience to the public during a prolonged period of limited usage of city streets and bridges\n\nGiven the reduced road traffic stemming from Governor Hogan\u2019s stay at home order, City Hall has an opportunity to address top-level issues in our transit system: filling potholes, moving forward with traffic light synchronization, and conducting road repairs. While we have released our broader transit plan of substantial, longer-term investments to build an equitable and green transit grid, there is immediate work to be done. City Hall should use borrowed funds to bolster the Department of Transportation\u2019s efforts and hire locally.\n\nCleanStat is one of CitiStat\u2019s initiatives to track the progress of the Department of Public Works, the Department of Transportation, the Code Enforcement team from the Department of Housing, and Bmore Beautiful. The site has been collecting data on the headway made as a part of Mayor Young\u2019s 50-Day Pothole Challenge, which was launched on February 12, 2020. The program set a goal to fill 5,000 potholes in 50 days; but as of March 10, 2020, CleanStat has uploaded no further data on the project\u2019s completion. City residents are still owed action, as promised, to fill the potholes. With less road traffic now than ever before, prioritizing pothole filling is common sense.\n\nFor years, Baltimore\u2019s commuters have lamented the frustrating congestion caused by non- synchronized traffic lights. The city has 1,300 city traffic signals, roughly three-quarters of which are designed to operate under one cohesive system, where timers are purposed to prevent constant red lights and speeding drivers. However, only half of those 974 signals were operating as designed under the timer system in 2017, resulting in clogged streets, an influx of run red lights, and more accidents.\n\nCity Hall should invest in a timing-optimization program and Intelligent Transportation System technology (ITS) to coordinate the signals of all 1,300 lights, minimizing traffic congestion and promoting safety.", "start_char_idx": 11832, "end_char_idx": 16182, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8177303d-6430-4c2d-98fc-4f4e1e7098eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8177303d-6430-4c2d-98fc-4f4e1e7098eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2123b828-8e80-4c19-a82f-7d212b6cd429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "70bd49f9f52c6725b4b182911d8c57979208862e34a92b14191458258ee22000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f5b9595-ed82-4d59-aa62-c51cb98b107b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "43d1859c48419f996542b00c387d77a4546970ead5791b6e7e0b064b2c5af535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0515761-f148-4110-90f4-fa6107853aeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c8706292eab927ff234809a8d0a531dabe81517ff2a67407f1be4c101f17b5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Complete installations of heat and air conditioning in public schools with inadequate systems while students, teachers, and staff are absent from these facilities for no less than 5 months\n\nWe hear our kids tell us how difficult it is to focus when they are sweating or shivering in classrooms. Year after year, we see identical headlines lamenting students sent home early when the weather turns especially hot or cold. A Johns Hopkins Study concluded that school closings due to inadequate facilities have resulted in 1.5 million educational hours collectively lost. In city schools with the largest achievement gaps, which often have student populations with disproportionate amounts of students of color and low-income students, this lost classroom time is even more detrimental. One Harvard study was able to determine that the difference in exam performance on a 90 degree day compared to a 72 degree day results is equivalent to a quarter of the Black-White student achievement gap.\n\nWith students out of schools due to COVID-19, the city has a rare opportunity to conduct repairs on aging buildings that are too-often without air conditioning in the summer and heating in the winter. With proper social distancing measures and safety precautions, we urge City Hall to hire locally to install critically needed H-VAC systems into the forty-seven schools lacking them.\n\nMap of Baltimore City Schools Without Air Conditioning\n\nSource: https://www.baltimorecityschools.org/ac\n\nStabilize first responders by guaranteeing appropriate overtime and hazard pay and by offering free local housing to avoid putting family members of essential workers at risk\n\nWe are forever indebted to the brave first responders putting themselves on the front lines of COVID- 19 to save lives and flatten the curve. City Hall will collect donations from both the public and philanthropic partners to establish a fund supporting these first responders and their families. Relief efforts paid for through these donations will be focused on alternative housing for self-isolation, hazard pay, and a catchall fund for necessities such as groceries.\n\n\nSupport mid-sized non-profits overlooked by federal stimulus and minimize burden on small businesses by waiving bills on minor privilege fees and extending deadlines on business invoices due to Baltimore City\n\nSmall businesses and startups serve a fundamental role in our economy, and they have suffered severe damage from the crisis. Eventually, will be safe for entrepreneurs and their employees to return to work. But the city has to do everything in its power to help keep small businesses afloat until public health leaders inform us that it is safe to return to life as normal.\n\nAt a regulatory level, the city can provide temporary relief for small businesses in the immediate crosshairs of coronavirus. The city could also provide a backstop for small businesses by halting commercial evictions for the duration of the crisis; and both streamlining and temporarily waiving minor privilege fees. Baltimore could help locally-owned restaurants and hotels by extending the deadline for business invoices related to food and beverage taxes and hotel/motel taxes.\n\nIn collaboration with state partners and leadership, Thiru will work to impose a temporary sales tax holiday and delay business tax payments for restaurants, hotels and motels, and other small businesses.\n\nAlso, non-profits working to serve Baltimore, particularly during COVID-19, are struggling. The Y in Central Maryland, an employer of more than 500 people, was considered too big to receive federal relief in initial stimulus. The organization has admirably stepped up for the community, but it has been left behind with a major loss of revenue. This gap is one the City should fill.\n\nProvide sick leave payments for high-risk essential workers\n\nThe Maryland Department of Labor has suggested that essential individuals who have not been quarantined but feel ill should use employer-paid time off. For a myriad of reasons, that time off may have already been used up, and \u2013 regardless \u2013 employers cap the amount of paid sick leave allotted. For many families, this limit means an impossible choice between putting food on the table and paying the bills or risking getting others or their family members sick.\n\nCities like San Francisco have realized the importance of sick leave in fighting this crisis \u2013 especially for high-risk essential workers who might not have enough leave to meet an appropriate recovery period. For those who are determined to be high-risk, or who are living with someone who is high-risk, we will leverage municipal funding to allocate funding to cover additional sick leave payments to match those originally determined by the employer. These additional sick days will remain until the stay-at-home order is lifted.\n\n\nSix to 18 Months: Build the Road to Recovery as We Reopen Our Economy", "start_char_idx": 16185, "end_char_idx": 21102, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0515761-f148-4110-90f4-fa6107853aeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0515761-f148-4110-90f4-fa6107853aeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2123b828-8e80-4c19-a82f-7d212b6cd429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "70bd49f9f52c6725b4b182911d8c57979208862e34a92b14191458258ee22000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8177303d-6430-4c2d-98fc-4f4e1e7098eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "f61a0b37798fcd14e07a0a2d62c2c588f5a163c2b4ca4a6c615d7a037f7f97c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fddd8f8-13bb-4cf1-aa7a-22365f9f8df3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bab928c1f4d883981865b07e4c2eb1910cade8d5c9e843784ce48efa9678a9ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Six to 18 Months: Build the Road to Recovery as We Reopen Our Economy\n\n\nBaltimore must act quickly to respond to the immediate and severe consequences of the virus, but it cannot lose sight of a brighter future on the horizon. When it is safe to begin reopening our streets and businesses, Thiru will jumpstart a vibrant, inclusive economy by beginning to cut property taxes, invigorating key industries, increasing businesses\u2019 access to capital, ensuring affordable housing, and developing creative partnerships to invest in our city\u2019s diverse and rapidly-evolving workforce.\n\nCommence schedule to cut property taxes in half over ten years in equal incremental reductions\n\nThere is no better barometer of the health of a city than its population growth and decline \u2013 and people are leaving Baltimore in droves. This year, Baltimore was confirmed to have a smaller population in 2020 than it had in 1920.\n\nFor too long, city residents have paid twice as much in property taxes as everyone else in Maryland, which naturally deflates property values, discourages investment, and induces families and businesses to leave the city. With soaring crime and broken schools, this tax rate has become harder and harder to explain. It\u2019s no wonder more and more residents and businesses are leaving Baltimore City for neighboring counties every year. Some 7,346 residents \u2014 over a percent of our population \u2014 left last year alone. And as the population has declined in Baltimore City over the past decade, the population in every surrounding county has grown.\n\nTo be sure, property taxes drive 32.7% of Baltimore\u2019s FY 2020 $2.9 billion operating budget. As a result, Baltimore cannot precipitously slash its tax rate without borrowing from the state or federal government or without significant reductions in services, neither of which is prudent or palatable.\n\nBut this trend should not paralyze us. While taxes cannot be realistically cut in half overnight, they can be gradually and responsibly reduced to county levels with a clear and disciplined plan. Thiru\u2019s proposal explains the mechanics of how it will be done, what revenue reductions will mean, how the city should prepare for these cuts, and what compensatory actions the city will take.\n\nReduce the property tax rate by .01 every year for 11 years (.22 to .21 to .20 and so forth) until it plateaus at .11, achieving equilibrium with other Maryland counties.\n\nBaltimore will responsibly cut property taxes while improving services by reducing the property tax rate by $.11 per $100 of assessed value each year for 10 years until it is competitive with neighboring jurisdictions. Over the decade, for a $200,000 home, these reductions will save a homeowner over $12,000. Under this plan, Baltimore City will adopt this preset schedule of tax reductions. As mayor, Thiru will require budgets prepared and ratified by City Hall to adhere to this schedule and will fix this schedule in a charter amendment.\n\nEven without greater discipline in agency budgets, there are several reasons why city revenue is projected to grow as property taxes are lowered.\n\n\n\nFirst, as cities like Boston and San Francisco have seen, pinning property tax rates can halt population flight and catalyze growth, which will generate both more property and income tax revenue in Baltimore. This is because new home purchases are based on price points determined by homeowners\u2019 maximum monthly payment. For example, a family willing to purchase a home at $500,000 at a property tax rate of 2.2% will pay the same in property taxes ($11,000) as a family that purchased a home at $550,000 with a tax rate of 2.0% ($11,000).\n\nCrack down on fraud and require agencies to identify 1.5% annually in wasteful spending.", "start_char_idx": 21033, "end_char_idx": 24768, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fddd8f8-13bb-4cf1-aa7a-22365f9f8df3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fddd8f8-13bb-4cf1-aa7a-22365f9f8df3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2123b828-8e80-4c19-a82f-7d212b6cd429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "70bd49f9f52c6725b4b182911d8c57979208862e34a92b14191458258ee22000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0515761-f148-4110-90f4-fa6107853aeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "50e0d5fd31aec656af3786c33a92903aef74c9fb1e4e4419f3f3cd56af33b5c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc63304c-0821-4f16-ae30-f813aef0d3ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "97faa3a39f5d0fbd571143878df9f9b926d17918c2ac55ec697ae74f4f97d130", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "First, as cities like Boston and San Francisco have seen, pinning property tax rates can halt population flight and catalyze growth, which will generate both more property and income tax revenue in Baltimore.

Because property taxes account for some 36% of the City\u2019s budget, proposed cuts will reduce revenues by as much as 1.8%. In response, agencies will cut $40 million in waste and fraud, each identifying 1.5% annually in wasteful spending based on annual, top-to-bottom independent audits of City Hall. Thiru will direct agency heads to crack down on waste, inefficiency, and fraud while preparing disciplined budgets consistent with the schedule of tax rate decreases. Unjustifiably high taxes are particularly offensive when taxpayers see consistent examples of misspent funds and fraud going unchecked.\n\nRaise taxes and penalties on absentee real estate speculators on vacant, unused properties.\n\nEven as Thiru reduces property taxes for property in active commercial and residential use, his plan will increase code violation penalties and property taxes on vacant properties being held at virtually no cost by property speculators, many of whom are not even based in Baltimore or Maryland. This kind of strategy has generated millions in revenue for cities like Washington, D.C., which raised the commercial property tax rate for vacant property from $1.65 to $5 for\n$100 in assessed value and to $10 per $100 of assessed value for blighted property. The prospect of increased taxes will either prompt development, raising the property value and thereby generate additional revenue; or the sale of the property to an owner prepared to make active use of the land.\n\nPursue legal action to seize property from absentee slumlords and speculators on vacant and abandoned properties with unpaid taxes and persistent code violations. Tax increases and legal action will not be directed at property in residential or commercial use.\n\nBaltimore loses significant potential tax revenue each year because of \u201chypervacancy\u201d \u2014 a term referring to neighborhoods where vacant buildings comprise more than 20% of that area\u2019s housing stock. The level of hypervacancy in Baltimore increased from 7.5% of census tracts across the city in 1990 to more than 30% by 2018.\n\nFollowing a model adopted by St. Petersburg, Florida, Baltimore will fight blight and generate revenue by taking ownership of vacant property with delinquent taxes or persistent code violations and sell them on auction or to affordable housing developers to further programs like Vacants to Value. In St. Petersburg, 800 vacant homes across the city owed $4 million in liens and unpaid assessments. Pursuing legal action reduced vacant homes by 75% in 4 years and generated $2.1 million in revenue. Baltimore has 17,000 vacant homes.\n\nThis plan is meant to reflect a new kind of leadership for Baltimore at a time when taxpayers are desperate for change.

Thiru plans to devote resources into building up these ten high-potential industries vital to Baltimore\u2019s future:\n\nBiotechnology and Health Care\n\nFew cities in the world boast world class institutional anchors like Johns Hopkins and the National Institutes of Health. In addition to the rich tradition of research and ingenuity that defines both institutions, Baltimore also already has a blossoming entrepreneurial culture. Coupled with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the University of Maryland, and UMBC, Baltimore\u2019s promise is limitless. To stimulate the biotech and healthcare industries in Baltimore, Thiru will lower taxes for biotech companies and invest in city-owned affordable incubator centers, located near prominent universities and research and development facilities, for biotech startups. This will include the city-subsidized expansions of AccelerateBaltimore and ETC Baltimore.\n\nCybersecurity and Coding\n\nCybersecurity is already emerging as a massively profitable strength for Baltimore. Several startups with meteoric trajectories have headquarters at Port Covington. U.S. cyber command is located at Fort Meade, just eighteen miles south of Baltimore City; and graduate programs in and around Baltimore have been educating the next generation of cybersecurity analysts and experts \u2013 creating an important talent pool for local employers. As mayor, Thiru will encourage and incentivize businesses and startups to find their home in Baltimore.\n\nSmall Businesses and Entrepreneurship\n\nSmall businesses comprise the backbone of any successful city. Especially in the wake of COVID-19, small business owners and employees need more support than ever before. To work towards rebuilding after the pandemic, Thiru pledges to introduce low-interest rainy-day loans and tax credits to owners, while organizing the philanthropic community\u2019s resources to operations that need assistance getting back on their feet.\n\nSmall businesses will struggle with liquidity both during and after the crisis, leaving many in the unenviable position of cutting costs and reducing payroll. Though the federal government has set up targeted loans through the Small Business Administration and Federal Main Street Business Lending Program, these time-intensive resources likely may prove \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d in reaching our business owners. Baltimore City must do all it can now to protect its small business sector. In the short term, Baltimore should follow the lead of cities like Chicago, who partnered with local Community Development Finance Institutions to provide $100 million in low-interest small business loans directly targeting historically under-resourced communities.\n\nThrough partnerships and mechanisms like public entity and city government funds, City Hall can amplify and match philanthropic and private relief.\n\nEven after the crisis, businesses may struggle to reopen their doors. On average, small businesses only have 27 days cash-on-hand \u2013 a number likely lower after the stress of COVID-\n19. The city should ensure that loan repayment does not inhibit business\u2019 ability to recover by allowing delayed repayments until the crisis has subsided. Additionally, Baltimore has a number of innovative microfinance programs to support small business growth and development; the mayor should work directly with these organizations to help promote their efforts and facilitate their ability to reach businesses in need of capital.\n\nIn order to recruit and retain more small business in Baltimore, Thiru has proposed three initiatives. First, as previously stated, he will streamline minor privilege and permitting fees that are costly and time-consuming. Second, he will pledge health insurance coverage for up to seven employees to companies that stay in Baltimore for at least 5 years. Lastly, Thiru is committed to ensuring that Baltimore\u2019s small businesses are representative of the great diversity our city has. He has promised to provide tax incentives to LGBTQ, female, immigrant, or minority-owned small businesses.\n\nAll of these initiatives are meant to be carried out in conjunction with Thiru\u2019s detailed plan to reduce violent crime and cut the murder rate in half. Small businesses cannot thrive in a city with 348 homicides a year. To specifically help small business owners, their employees, and consumers, Thiru has pledged to provide incentives to purchase, install, and register cloud- based security cameras and give financial assistance to small businesses interested in partnering with security firms.\n\nArts, Film, and Music\n\nBaltimore\u2019s rich history in art, film, and music has historically been an engine for growth. Baltimore has all the promise to once more become a cultural leader in the arts. As mayor, Thiru will be committed to reigniting the arts industry through several initiatives.\n\nThiru will expand and support the creation of additional arts and entertainment districts.

Baltimore has all the promise to once more become a cultural leader in the arts. As mayor, Thiru will be committed to reigniting the arts industry through several initiatives.\n\nThiru will expand and support the creation of additional arts and entertainment districts. Thiru recently stood with Peter Brooks, grandson of Jazz legend Cab Calloway, to protest the demolition of Calloway\u2019s historic childhood home in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. He is committed to preserving the legacies of Baltimore\u2019s many successful Black and Brown musicians and artists and building inclusive spaces for the new generation of trailblazers. As\n\nmayor, he will extend tax-free income benefits in art districts to include a more inclusive concept of \u201cartists\u201d by allowing, for example, musicians, spoken word artists, and filmmakers.\n\nFrom The Wire to Hairspray, Baltimore has been the stage of incredible shows and movies. Thiru will re-establish financial incentives to encourage television producers and filmmakers to set their works in the city and provide jobs for hundreds of Baltimoreans.\n\nThiru has also planned to lead a capital campaign to raise funds from private donors to reinforce the shaky financial foundation of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.\n\nCulinary Arts\n\nThere are three reasons why culinary arts have become a critical part of Baltimore\u2019s future. First, the food and beverage industry provides accessible opportunities to build successful careers \u2013 the industry is the highest percentage employer of ex-felons in the country, and over a fifth of restaurant workers are immigrants. Second, while there are numerous entrepreneurs in this industry who have been contributing to the cultural experience of our city for generations, Baltimore has a number of innovative restaurant owners, chefs, and industry players who are pushing the industry to new heights. Third, Baltimore\u2019s restaurant industry attracts consumers within and beyond Baltimore who are willing to pay a premium for the quality of experiences our businesses offer. Thiru will inject capital and resources into up-and-coming culinary districts and introduce tax benefits for employers willing to hire returning citizens.\n\nMedical and Recreational Cannabis\n\nThe marijuana marketplace in Baltimore is currently a chaotic free-for-all, contributing to record violence while depriving taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars. Illegal trade occurs unimpeded as police and prosecutors publicly squabble about whether to enforce current laws, even as street marijuana is increasingly laced with fentanyl and K-2. Medical cannabis is booming, but cannot be taxed and has virtually no licensees of color.\n\nThe bottom line: a billion dollars is spent on cannabis products each year, which largely ends up either in monopolized hands of untaxed licensees or violent gangs and drug organizations.\n\nThis is the worst of all worlds. Violence is unabated, avoidable overdoses persist, and drug proceeds remain locked in a violent black market. Moving the cannabis trade out of the shadows and into a well-regulated, transparent market will (1) reduce gun violence driven by\n\ncompeting gangs, (2) decrease overdose death from laced marijuana, (3) mitigate the racial wealth gap, and (4) provide vital revenue to fund universal pre-K, finance repairs and upgrades at K-12 school facilities, guarantee free college in Maryland for public school graduates, and grow HBCU endowments. Baltimore City cannot afford to wait for indecisive lawmakers in Annapolis to take action while the City suffers from the failed war on drugs.\n\nJust as Colorado and other states have issued permits and taxed the sale of cannabis despite its legal status under federal law, so too should Baltimore City issue sales permits and tax cannabis. The same people who think Baltimore City has to wait for Maryland law to change thought Colorado had to wait for federal law to change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Baltimore to lead, not follow.\n\nIssue Permits to Baltimore Businesses to Aid Communities of Color\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure. For decades, communities of color have disproportionately shouldered the costs of Baltimore\u2019s enforcement policies. Now that America is realizing its mistake, the communities who were most devastated by the failed policies of the 1980s ought to be the first to benefit from this emerging market.\n\nPermits will be preferentially issued to enterprises owned, operated, and controlled by historically-disadvantaged, local business owners of color and to those who commit to hire employees with non-violent criminal records who are seeking legitimate employment opportunities.", "start_char_idx": 32806, "end_char_idx": 37949, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eee3f89-77a2-41ba-a6d4-c31dd2117543": {"__data__": {"id_": "3eee3f89-77a2-41ba-a6d4-c31dd2117543", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2123b828-8e80-4c19-a82f-7d212b6cd429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "70bd49f9f52c6725b4b182911d8c57979208862e34a92b14191458258ee22000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "efaa6191-046e-412f-abc1-71951700e750", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "cb19558f206a60ecc0dd38fa4a5cfb82f25adf26c27c4eda382729e57008a70d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a90d4ba-4aa0-409e-ba82-87c67ec58f5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "feae8814ff1774d9419f8f896650e1b044fd7d8b568dbb5b74467f9170be5895", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The same people who think Baltimore City has to wait for Maryland law to change thought Colorado had to wait for federal law to change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Baltimore to lead, not follow.\n\nIssue Permits to Baltimore Businesses to Aid Communities of Color\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure.

Maryland and others will inevitably legalize marijuana, but there is a first- mover advantage in this industry that the City should seize. In the past, residents have been promised funds for education from controversial ventures like casinos only to see money diluted or redirected to other priorities. This won\u2019t happen again.\n\nAll cannabis tax proceeds will be strictly dedicated to key education programs, starting with (1) universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old child, (2) repairs and improvements at K-12 facilities, (3) free college, community college, or trade school for public high\n\nschool graduates, and (4) funding to grow the endowments of HBCUs. These funds will be used only to support new programs and to supplement, not replace, current funding sources for the expansion of existing programs.\n\nEstablish Infrastructure to Manage Complex Emerging Market\n\nThe City will establish a commission comprising community members \u2013 with the requirement that no member holds a conflict of interest \u2013 who will manage and make permitting decisions. The process and decision-making will be fully public and transparent so there are no doubts who made the decision and why.\n\nBaltimore will create a city-operated credit union that holds the proceeds of cannabis sales, and distributes taxes to vital education programs, and eventually makes its reserve funds available for low-interest student and small business loans.\n\nThiru will appoint a safety board that will ensure that recreational cannabis is safe and free of dangerous additives like fentanyl and will create and communicate clear regulations about when, where, and how the product can be sold and used.\n\nIn theory, prosecutors in states like Colorado could bring charges under federal drug laws at their discretion. In practice, they never have. The premise of the proposed approach is that prosecutors in Baltimore have better things to do with their time than to go after permitted, minority-owned cannabis dispensaries based in Baltimore who hire residents desperately trying to obtain legitimate employment to turn their lives around. Issuing city permits and collecting taxes would no more make the sales legal under state law than issuing state licenses makes the sales legal under federal law. But, with ingenuity and leadership, we can still bring the marijuana trade out of the dangerous shadows\u2014where gangs kill over turf\u2014and create a safer market that redresses racial inequities and generates massive tax revenue at a time when Baltimore desperately needs it.\n\nCancer Research\n\nBaltimore boasts world-class medical institutions and research facilities that have recently been alienated from partnerships with City Hall. Thiru will support these stakeholders to make our city a magnet for medical innovation and discovery. Thiru is committed to shaping Baltimore into the nation\u2019s hub for groundbreaking cancer research. Under his leadership, we will partner with Johns Hopkins and the region\u2019s many neighboring colleges and universities to find a cure.\n\nDriverless Vehicles\n\nAutonomous vehicles will still need years of development and millions of miles of training their neural networks with live drivers behind the wheel. The hesitation of other cities, which is already starting to dissipate, presents a tremendous opportunity for Baltimore. Particularly given the critical importance of Baltimore\u2018s port \u2014 which remains a destination of choice for car manufacturers in Europe and Asia \u2013 this is a chance for Baltimore to become the next century\u2019s Detroit in terms of manufacturing and innovation. With immediate access to the vital I-70 interstate, this industry of the future is one Baltimore City should dominate.\n\nTourism & Hospitality\n\nIn 2017, 26.2 million people visited Baltimore, spending $5.7 billion in direct sales and generating $100 million in sales tax revenue. The tourism industry is a major employer in Baltimore, supporting over 85,500 jobs in Baltimore and its surrounding areas.

However, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 have only exacerbated the strain on the industry, its workers, and their families. While we must ensure that all employees within the tourism and hospitality industries earn a living wage and have opportunities for upward mobility. Given Baltimore\u2019s location and enormous cultural assets, there are tremendous growth opportunities to make tourism a vibrant economic engine.\n\nTourism thrives when Baltimore thrives \u2013 first, we need to make our city safe. Thiru pledges that his 20-point crime plan of unprecedented strategies will cut the murder rate in half. When we see real change on our streets, tourism will rise.\n\nPort Development\n\nThree advantages \u2013 Baltimore\u2019s proximity to Washington D.C., its location along the I-95 and Amtrak corridor, and its large and booming port \u2013 make the city not only easily and quickly accessible, but an area marked for its potential for economic development.\n\nBaltimore boasts the 11th largest U.S. port regarding the handling of international cargo and is the country\u2019s 9th largest measured by value. Our port has both public and private terminals that, in 2018, imported and exported 43 million tons of cargo and is set to be the departure point for 100 cruises next year.\n\nAs mayor, Thiru will invest even more into the development and renovation of Baltimore\u2019s port to incentivize more traffic and generate stable, well-paying jobs for Baltimoreans.

Our port has both public and private terminals that, in 2018, imported and exported 43 million tons of cargo and is set to be the departure point for 100 cruises next year.\n\nAs mayor, Thiru will invest even more into the development and renovation of Baltimore\u2019s port to incentivize more traffic and generate stable, well-paying jobs for Baltimoreans. First, he will ensure the reconstruction of the Howard Street Tunnel. An expansion of the freight tunnel will increase freight clearances and allow for more transport of goods from Baltimore\u2019s port to other jurisdictions while creating hundreds of construction jobs. The federal government has already granted money for this project, and private partnerships can mitigate remaining costs.\n\n\nRaise property taxes on abandoned properties to ensure that real estate speculators are induced to promptly begin development or sell property holdings to investors who will\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence linking neighborhoods of concentrated disinvestment to violent crime, it is impossible to discuss the epidemic of violence in Baltimore today without accounting for our city\u2019s history of housing segregation. A lack of affordable housing in the city often results in inherent instability for low income residents and contributes to the rise of abandoned blocks across the city. Unable to afford a safe place to live, tenants are often forced to either settle for substandard housing or become regular defendants in Baltimore\u2019s rent courts.\n\nThis lack of stable housing affects more than just the roof over one\u2019s head. Every house is linked to a community which provides (or deprives) a family access to good schools, quality food, and a safe environment. It is no surprise that quality stable housing is linked to longer and healthier lives. In Baltimore, this difference is visible in the variation of life expectancy across the city - with residents of Roland Park living an average of 14 years longer than those from Sandtown-Winchester.\n\nFor too long, Baltimore has focused its time and resources towards a few select areas of the city. The long-term solution rests in ensuring adequate investment across the city so that Baltimore is a united city, rather than a checkerboard of opportunity. While the city lacks the funds to directly invest in all neighborhoods, it possesses strong economic and political tools to redirect capital equitably.\n\nWith over 17,000 vacant properties, Baltimore is sitting on untapped housing potential. Several cities in California have moved to tax properties that are unoccupied for an extensive period of time. This diminishes incentives for speculators who acquire properties and hold them until their value is raised for resale or they can command a higher rent. By taxing long term vacancies, the city can push property holders to either increase recruitment efforts to find tenants, or reduce rents to more reasonable levels. Property owners who are unwilling to do this will face taxes that help the city fund initiatives to combat the known impacts of high levels of vacant housing.\n\nCut vacant housing stock by using eminent domain to seize property with excessive code violations and unpaid taxes and transfer it to affordable housing organizations\n\nBaltimore city code permits city acquisition of abandoned property when the property is deemed a public safety threat and the owner of the property has failed to take the proper course of action to correct the problem. Despite having this authority for years, city leadership has failed to leverage their power and reclaim property from absentee landlords who have let it fall into disarray. In most of the incidences in which the city has exercised its authority - it has done so to demolish properties rather than invest in their revitalization or future development.\n\nWhen done properly, the city\u2019s ability to condemn and seize property can work to the public\u2019s benefit. Evidence from St. Petersburg showed a near 75% reduction in vacant homes when the city began efforts to hand these properties to non-profits, who used them to construct affordable housing for residents. This effort functions to prevent abandoned housing from bringing down the value of entire blocks while also returning properties from absentee landlords to communities who could put them to good use. Thiru plans to seize abandoned homes from owners who refuse to care for them and subsequently sell these properties to community housing organizations.\n\n\n\nRelaunch dollar-homes program with modified city subsidies to banks, reinvest in community land trusts to expand long-term affordable housing, and effectively safeguard tenants\u2019 rights\n\nRelaunch Dollar Homes Program\n\nThiru commits to finally act on the words and promises of past politicians and bring back the Dollar Homes Program. Under the program, residents can buy a vacant home from the city for only $1 if they promise to (1) commit 100k towards renovating the property and (2) live in the residence for at least 5 years.

The program will be directed at supporting local living for law enforcement and first responders, teachers, and social workers.\n\nIn order for this program to succeed, Thiru will explore partnerships with local banks and lenders to ensure that those looking to buy a home through the program have access to the financial support they need in order to rehabilitate the property. City Hall will commit to purchasing insurance against the value of the home, then provide lending institutions guarantees that their investments are secure.\n\nAs necessary, the city will co-invest to cover any differential between appraised value of the home and money needed to rehabilitate it. By working with banks to secure low-interest loans, Dollar Homes can be made accessible to residents who otherwise may not be able to access home ownership.\n\nInvest In and Support Community Land Trusts\n\nGiven the disparity in homeownership rates in the Baltimore area \u2013 white residents are three times more likely to own a home than black residents \u2013 City Hall needs to do more to ensure that homeownership is accessible to black and low income residents. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are a promising means of collective ownership of land and capital. CLTs are nonprofits that buy land and maintain ownership of homes in the city, and then enter long-term, renewable leases with homeowners at affordable rates. When the homeowner sells, the family earns a portion of the increased property value as a stakeholder in the CLT, while the remainder is kept by the trust to preserve the affordability of the housing.\n\nExamples from Boston have shown the ways in which CLTs can provide homeownership opportunities to individuals who would normally be limited to rental options. In Baltimore, the Northeast Housing Initiative has taken similar steps to build community ownership of property. However, given the amount of time and support these initiatives require, it is important that we look to their long-term value \u2013 not just their immediate payoffs. Each home that a CLT secures helps their initiative expand further, and is a guaranteed affordable home for generations to come. Every resident who owns a CLT home feels the pride and reaps the benefits of owning their own home, but also is securing their future by investing in their land trust\u2019s equity. Given that homeownership is one of the key means of generating wealth for Americans, it is imperative that Baltimore support CLTs and other means of affordable homeownership. Thiru will partner with community organizations with the knowledge that these impacts take generations to see, but are incredibly important to strive for today.\n\nGuarantee Legal Assistance for Tenants Facing Rent Court\n\nRental agreements are underlined by a power imbalance between renter and landlord. When facing eviction, tenants often are rushed through rent courts with little understanding of the system or their rights. Tenants rarely have representation and few know how to defend their cases in court, presenting landlords with the upper hand.\n\nThiru will commit to increasing public attorney resources to defend tenants facing evictions in rent court, allotting them a fighting chance at repelling invalid eviction charges. While the city would be unable to provide a personal attorney for all cases \u2013 150,000 cases interact with rent court annually \u2013\n\nthe city should provide a centralized access point to legal resources regarding Rent Court procedures, the status of their cases, and housing assistance services to halt eviction.\n\nThiru will also support adding city renter protections that prevent evictions unless the landlord could prove just cause for eviction, similar to those implemented recently in San Jose.\n\nExpand Eviction Prevention Policies and Post-Eviction Rehousing Services\n\nIt is time that we stop considering homelessness a problem once the person has already lost their home. Baltimore can reduce costs associated with emergency housing and prevent tenants from needing to uproot from their communities by expanding eviction prevention policies safeguarding renters in need of short-term assistance. The HomeStart program, based in Boston, seeks to prevent tenant evictions by helping manage the cases of at-risk tenants, negotiating agreements with landlords and covering back rent payments when necessary. Landlords avoid the high costs of eviction, the city spends less on emergency housing services, and tenants can continue to stay in their homes.

We need to unite our best assets and key stakeholders under a comprehensive plan \u2013 across silos and barriers \u2013 to sustainably lift up individuals and communities in every neighborhood.\n\nThiru\u2019s Strategic Partnership Initiative will spur equitable growth and drive the cross-sector partnerships needed to solve our city\u2019s most challenging problems.

He has already proposed his Court to Career (C2C) Program, which is an adult diversion initiative; along with its parallel program, School to Success (S2S), which is purposed for diverting juvenile offenders. Both programs match individuals with employment opportunities with room for advancement and growth.\n\nIn its first full year, C2C and S2S will help divert 1,000 individuals who are charged with low-level offenses from the revolving door of poverty, crime, and prison to a constructive path of job training and paid employment opportunities as a condition of receiving a probation before judgment (PBJ). This will require partnerships between district court judges and juvenile masters, probation officers, case workers, skills training programs, apprenticeships, and employers who are prepared to hire at-risk individuals and give them a second chance. Only when individuals complete the program, having demonstrated stable employment and no criminal activity, are they taken off probation with their records expunged.\n\nFor juveniles, the programs will adopt apprenticeships and work schedules that are compatible with school and other vital obligations. School to Success will prioritize programs geared to all facets of enterprise and academic achievement.

Though our city has suffered from job erosion and disinvestment, Baltimore\u2019s potential is tremendous. We are a city that pioneers the cutting-edge of medicine, launches next-generation businesses, and sets the standard for creativity in the arts. Our restaurants make headlines while creating community. We welcome immigrants while celebrating businesses that have thrived in Baltimore for generations. Baltimore has nearly 14,000 businesses, both big and small; and one third of our labor force \u2013 one of the highest percentages in the country \u2013 devotes their careers to service through the nonprofit sector. We are a city shaped by individuals dedicated to the promise of progress.\n\nThiru will offer Baltimore a New Deal for the next generation by injecting a massive stimulus investment, redesigning our transit network and water \u2013 sewage system, rebuilding our crumbling schools, and leading the nation in smart city innovations. This \u201cNext Generation New Deal\u201d will help unleash our city\u2019s full promise, a promise of prosperity and equity, hope and opportunity.\n\nLaunch massive $3-4 billion investment in infrastructure overhaul over the next decade, pledging to match federal stimulus funds with public-private city investments for five major commitments.\n\nAs Baltimore ushers in a new era of economic development, City Hall must begin a second round of infrastructure investments. Thiru has pledged to match federal stimulus funds granted to the city by again borrowing against the city\u2019s AA municipal bond rating, this time a sum of $3.5 billion, to invest over a five \u2013 10-year period. This will be supplemented by leveraging philanthropic partnerships and coordinating with investors and businesses.\n\nThe funds will go towards five major initiatives: (1) the design and construction of a green transit network, (2) building a water/waste system that is in compliance with the federal consent decree, (3) launching massive renovations of city schools, (4) constructing an equitable transit grid, and (5) beginning smart city investments.\n\nMajor public transit initiatives to potentially include East-West light rail, revitalized trolley cars, Inner Harbor footbridge, above-ground circular shuttle train, and high-speed rail to DC\n\nDue to necessary social distancing guidelines, Baltimore\u2019s transit system has significantly decreased its operations by limiting lines and routes. Once the COVID-19 crisis subsides, Thiru will work with state and local transit authorities to restore Baltimore\u2019s transit system to greater capacity than before the public health crisis, creating an equitable transit grid while also offering an array of new employment opportunities at all levels.\n\nThiru will prioritize two major public works projects: expanding free circulator routes to include major west-to-east corridors and critical arteries to historically disinvested neighborhoods; and leading the charge to build the primary route of America\u2019s first high-speed rail line, connecting Baltimore and Washington, D.C. These projects will lay the groundwork for the exploration of other transit alternatives, from a revitalized trolley car system to an above ground circulator to gondolas to a footbridge across the harbor.\n\nThe city's free transit system\u2014the Charm City Circulator\u2014is designed by Visit Baltimore, which is a 501c6 with municipal and corporate partners, designed specifically to market the city\u2014not to provide widespread\npublic transit. We need to reform the purpose of free-fare buses to specifically target riders who lack alternative transit options. Expanding free circulator routes to East-West corridors and major arterial roadways like Pennsylvania Avenue and Harford Road will reduce pollution as ridership increases, reduce commute times, make the City more accessible, and facilitate economic development by providing realistic transportation to job centers and employers. Economic empowerment through transit is critical to Baltimore, which suffers higher unemployment rates than neighboring jurisdictions. Thiru will lobby to start construction of the proposed 14-mile East-West transit line between Baltimore County and downtown, connecting the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC train and instituting a comprehensive transit grid.\n\nThiru will lead the fight to break ground on the first American leg of high-speed rail connecting DC and Baltimore with a 13-minute bullet train, guaranteeing substantially discounted commuter fares based on income, and induce competitive, international bidding to reduce overall project costs.", "start_char_idx": 58753, "end_char_idx": 63542, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94d19a4c-0ecf-41f6-96af-38d96f41cc80": {"__data__": {"id_": "94d19a4c-0ecf-41f6-96af-38d96f41cc80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2123b828-8e80-4c19-a82f-7d212b6cd429", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "70bd49f9f52c6725b4b182911d8c57979208862e34a92b14191458258ee22000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1eb19f75-ed69-48d4-af32-cdd534549c88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "Economy Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 70715, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee635defbe93bf895fa5b61ca5c3a4b1c1902cc129ec4cb1add263acfa2a3529", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6b6f6f5-6404-4b03-a4f2-ab4bab5cd395", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee910b7fc76f93c03a4bdd74c90350d4f445b1aa6731ab4428ed8c349ae86ee0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rebuild green network of roads and bridges, which are currently at risk of collapsing, with dedicated thoroughfares for public transit, combined with bike lanes and completion of 35-mile Gwynn Falls and Herring Run trail loop\nThiru will execute a Complete Streets redesign that considers the racial and socioeconomic equity of our roads and bridges.

We will use sensors attached to city-owned vehicles, which naturally traverse the city, to measure width, depth, and severity of potholes; and then log that data into a publicly-available system. This monitoring serves as a measure of accountability, ensuring that the public can track and visualize the completion of 311 calls and that the most severe and significant potholes are filled first.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s current water billing system is inherently flawed, and notoriously issues exorbitantly high bills to residents resulting from undetected, yet often preventable, leaks. When a resident sees a high bill and calls in to complain, the Department of Public Works (DPW) examines hourly water usage; if the meter is constantly running all day and all night long, DPW naturally concludes there may be a leak, big or small, and then takes action. But there is no reason DPW should wait for residents to call-in about data DPW already has in its possession. As mayor, Thiru will implement computer monitoring of hourly meter rates to detect sudden spikes in usage or constant water flow that are symptoms of water leaks. Leaks left undetected and unattended, combined with crumbling infrastructure, have direct consequences \u2013 like Poe Homes being left without water for weeks, and recurring stories about sinkholes developing in and around our city. Catching leaks early and taking steps to fix them will reduce costs for the city, save families money, and lower the risk of catastrophic water main breaks.\n\nThiru will lead the effort for universal fiber optic internet infrastructure made free for public consumption. He will initiate competitive bidding among providers before laying the groundwork to ensure coverage in all neighborhoods, making Baltimore the national leader in internet accessibility.\n\nSmart technology can be designed to serve two purposes: to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability, and to reduce operation costs. Thiru will install LED bulbs into streetlights, which can be dimmed and brightened in accordance with data on location, weather, and time of day. City Hall will also prioritize research and data collection on air pollution and waste management in order to develop the cleanest possible policies and procedures.\n\nA FINAL NOTE\n\nWe will make Baltimore all it can be by building an economy that works for all of us \u2013 in all neighborhoods, across all walks of life. Acting on this clear, inclusive vision is exponentially more important as we enter a period of economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our campaign knows that low-income and minority communities are hit harder by the virus, and will face the brunt of the economic challenges it brings. Implementing long-term investments through these three-phase initiatives will directly support those most impacted by the crisis in the short-term, while ushering in a new era for Baltimore\u2019s economy as we move to a brighter future.

Here's his five-point plan to adress racial disparities in COVID-19 testing and treatment.\n\nIncrease Testing & Drop Referral Requirement for at-risk Populations\nRight now, you must have a doctor's referral to be tested for COVID-19. Access to doctors is not universal. To protect at-risk populations, the doctor referral requirement should be lifted for anyone over the age of 50 living in the hardest hit neighborhoods, like 21215.\nHouse Essential Workers in Hotel Rooms for Self-Isolation\nEssential workers who are unable to isolate themselves at home should be offered free, alternative housing at hotels and motels for a 14-21 day period. Priority should be given to residents living in zip codes deemed to be COVID-19 hotspots.\nPartner with Community Leadership and Prominent Health Care Institutions\nBaltimore is home to world-class medical research facilities and hospitals. To ensure that communities that need increased testing receive the resources and treatment they need, City Hall should join our medical institutions in strategic partnerships with non-profit organizations, faith communities, and volunteers already well-established and connected on the ground.\nHalt Non-Essential Demolition and Construction in COVID-19 Hotspots\nFollowing the lead of New York and Boston, Thiru is calling for the suspension of all non- essential construction and demolition projects. Exceptions should be approved through the submission of an Essential Construction request.\nEstablish Modern Healthcare Infrastructure in Disconnected Communities\nThiru will partner with philanthropic organizations to provide internet and computer access to public housing units.

This will currently take months to ramp up.\n\nTo ensure communities receive resources and treatment,  our  medical institutions and City Hall must strategically partner with non-profit organizations, faith centers, and volunteers already well-established and connected on the ground. Particularly for low income individuals without access to private transit, some may only receive treatment at the most severe stages of their infection.\n\nDeveloped partnerships will also facilitate distribution  of  accurate information and COVID-19 tests through pop-up centers, adequately staffed for screenings, in transit deserts and hotspots. If we are unable to safely transport potential vectors to testing locations, we must directly bring the resources to hotspot locations.\n\nHealth care disparities will not vanish when the current pandemic abates. To restructure how Baltimore treats health needs, Thiru proposes:\nProviding Access to Telemedicine Infrastructure\n\nThiru has pledged to guarantee free, universal access to  high-speed wifi across the city. We know families need access now, and the digital divide leaves disinvested neighborhoods at a further disadvantage -- this was true prior to this crisis, emboldened during COVID-19, and, if we do not act now, will remain a reality for years to come. City Hall will partner with philanthropic organizations to provide internet and computer access to all public housing units. The current pandemic has revealed the importance of telemedicine infrastructure that allows patients to conveniently communicate with care providers. Telemedicine eradicates transit barriers to visiting a professional and enables real-time assessment of health issues, in turn enabling quick action to treat serious concerns. Investing in digital infrastructure will also create overarching benefits to public health by allowing children to remain engaged with their education, granting access to information and news updates, and eliminating barriers to job and assistance program applications.\nLaunching Health Intervention Program in Collaboration with Faith Communities\n\nAddressing entrenched health care disparities requires collaboration  between the public sector and community stakeholders. The Mecklenberg Health Department demonstrated this expertly with their Village HeartBEAT program, which facilitates fun, healthy competition amongst faith based congregations to improve health metrics. In addition to competition on health indicators such as weight, exercise, tobacco use, and dietary choices, the program trains community awareness ambassadors and connects members to health services. Establishing a network in Baltimore that both encourages daily changes to improve health and identifies need for additional information and services would benefit people who have historically faced insurmountable barriers to health care.\n\nExpanding Medicaid Coverage for the Uninsured\n\nTesting and treatment for COVID-19 may cost up to  $73,000  out-of-pocket for individuals without health insurance. According to the 2020 American Census, approximately 6.4% of Baltimore City residents under the age of 65 do not have medical insurance coverage. A global pandemic only exacerbates the existing health care inequities in our communities and victimizes those with pre-existing conditions, which occur at higher rates in minority populations. City leadership should embrace this opportunity to restructure our insufficient insurance coverage in Baltimore City by providing year long, city-backed medical grants to all uninsured adults that do not qualify for Medicaid coverage due to income limits. The Affordable Care Act provides subsidized health insurance for individuals from 100-400% of the Federal Poverty Line. These grants would provide the balance of the health insurance cost under the Affordable Care Act for those who are not covered by Medicaid. These grants can be renewed for the duration of the crisis, and/or until the recipient obtains employee-sponsored coverage or can independently afford insurance coverage.", "start_char_idx": 2494, "end_char_idx": 7615, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a5bae34-a41f-47e6-a702-cad720edc447": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a5bae34-a41f-47e6-a702-cad720edc447", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c53a7e6b-208e-4712-8cc2-809ca6cb3c97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ede9b02b243a0fedabbb87b9f6cae06c0bafc31e8101c6347704b2de376e7b31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b6426cf-25ac-4c2c-a19c-8827b50e5ab2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "57817dfddb72d2a3605e05502532ff9d8773fb0e808467bca1bd2f9891a561e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f03d25e6-fa4d-45e5-8b75-1887e3deeb68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9528ad0e41a1f30e3f7f7ef0e78503e0e4005d1859f8bd3ffe18afc77354e3b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Baltimore will ban flavored tobacco products including e-cigarettes\nAs the FDA and CDC have cautioned, flavored vaping and tobacco products, like cigarillos and menthol cigarettes, present a grave health risk, particularly to children. It is no accident the use of e-cigarettes and vapes among young people has exploded, as 7 out of 10 teens are exposed to e-cigarette ads. Major e-cigarette makers are pushing colorful tobacco products, using mobile platforms like YouTube and Twitter, and promoting teen-friendly flavors. Already, 10% of high school students use e-cigarettes\u2014and more than\n60 toxins have been identified in liquid flavored products. Baltimore should follow cities from San Francisco to Chicago to Minneapolis, which have prohibited flavored products to protect their citizens and children.\nEnact complete prohibition of e-cigarettes in indoor public spaces\nThe CDC has reported that e-cigarettes not only contain nicotine, but also have lead, nickel, tin, volatile organic compounds, and diacetyl, a chemical linked to a serious lung disease. Secondary aerosol inhalation increases the risks of asthma in young children, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory symptoms and infections. Baltimore should build on its partial indoor prohibition, close the loopholes, and forbid smoking of e-cigarettes in all places cigarette smoke is banned, including bars and restaurants.\n\nInitiate city lawsuit against e-cigarette manufacturer JUUL\nNew York City and DC recently filed major lawsuits against JUUL for illegally targeting youth and intentionally misleading consumers about the consequences of its products. According to the CDC, a single JUUL or e-liquid pod contains the same amount of nicotine as roughly 20 packs of cigarettes. Just as we sued drug companies for fueling the opioid crisis, Baltimore should join the movement of cities suing this industry for creating the latest youth health crisis.\nImpose tax on e-cigarettes to fund children\u2019s health screenings at city elementary schools\nLike neighboring locales, Baltimore should impose a 50% wholesale tax on vaping products (between Montgomery County\u2019s 30% and DC\u2019s 96%), plus an additional $0.10/mL tax on e-liquids containing nicotine. The tax proceeds would pay for comprehensive health screenings of city elementary school children, as well as youth prevention efforts and treatment for those addicted.\n\nKeep tobacco money out, refuse campaign donations from industry and lobbyists\nOur campaign pledges to refuse political donations from tobacco and e-cigarette companies, as well as from their executives and lobbyists. The tobacco industry has made significant contributions to Baltimore leaders in order to block regulations that would protect our children from their harmful products. Citizens deserve to know that their health and safety comes first, not campaign finances and industry profits.\n\n\u201cI want Baltimore to become the most inviting and hospitable city in the country for the LGBTQ+ community.

Thiru stands as a proud ally to the LGBTQ community and will work with local leaders to promote policies that account for the reality that discrimination manifests itself differently depending upon race, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\nThiru\u2019s policy framework will focus on a range of  issues important to Baltimore\u2019s LGBTQ community\nand aim to break remaining barriers to full equality, including:\nPromote LGBTQ-owned small businesses, entrepreneurs, and city districts\nEnable services to account for challenges facing LGBTQ youth in Baltimore\nPrioritize inclusive workplace policies and trainings for all city employees\nAppoint an official LGBTQ Liaison within the Mayor\u2019s Executive Office\nAddress the needs of at-risk LGBTQ populations including veterans and seniors\nProtect transgender citizens from crime and discriminatory enforcement\nImprove and expand health services for members of the LGBTQ community\nBroaden LGBTQ Commission\u2019s responsibilities to include training and privacy-sensitive data collection for evidence-based policy making\nPromote LGBTQ-owned small businesses, entrepreneurs, and city districts\nBaltimore must invite small businesses and create business  alliances across the board. That said, it can take steps to specifically assist and accommodate local LGBTQ-owned businesses as well. Thiru will incorporate LGBTQ-owned businesses into the incentive programs that function through the Office of Minority and Women-Owned Business Development, in order to rightfully acknowledge their role in providing services to the citizens of Baltimore and in creating a more inclusive, diverse space for community. Building on residential and commercial districts that serve and celebrate LGBTQ culture, Thiru will also prioritize city and private investment in welcoming, inclusive neighborhoods.\n\nEnable services to account for challenges facing LGBTQ youth in Baltimore\nProtecting LGBTQ Identities in Schools\nIn April of 2019, the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners  passed Policy JBB, which ensures that transgender students have access to the restrooms of their preference and are referred to by the right gender/pronouns in class and on official documents and records. To make Baltimore\u2019s public schools even more inclusive, Thiru will establish LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum and support LGBTQ youth anti-harassment campaigns.\nCatering Homeless Shelters to LGBTQ Youth\nAccording to a recent study, roughly 40% of the homeless  youth population in the United States identify as LGBTQ. Thiru will employ the Mayor\u2019s Office of Human Services to equip Baltimore\u2019s pre-existing homeless shelters, along with transitional and supportive housing, with the resources to best serve LGBTQ youth, such as increased counseling staff, tailored job training, and access to health services.\nFounding a LGBTQ drop-in center\nThe Department of Health and Human Services shows that  LGBTQ individuals are far more likely to experience clinical depression and are roughly three times more likely to complete suicide. For these reasons, New York City has just pledged 4.8 million dollars to opening a new 24 hour drop in center for LGBTQ youth. Baltimore should follow the example of other cities and create its own drop-in center. The center would unite resources and actors, like schools and community organizations, around our LGBTQ youth.\nPrioritize inclusive workplace policies and trainings for all city employees\nDiscrimination in the workplace is an unfortunate reality for many in the LGBTQ community. Baltimore City Agencies must take proactive steps to combat prejudice against their employees. In an effort to increase accountability and establish a welcoming, respectful environment for LGBTQ employees, Thiru will implement mandatory and recurring inclusivity training for city employees, beginning with new hires. The city\u2019s existing LGBTQ Commission will head training efforts. In addition, Thiru will require there to be at least one gender-neutral bathroom in all city-owned buildings and adjust city government forms to include gender neutral language and non-binary identities.\nAppoint an official LGBTQ Liaison within the Mayor\u2019s Executive Office:\nTo increase the awareness of LGBTQ issues within the  mayor\u2019s executive office, Thiru will establish an official LGBTQ Liaison.

The LGBTQ Liaison will convene with community members, local organizations, and relevant city entities to learn about the issues that Baltimore\u2019s LGBTQ people face every day. The liaison will review city policies and services, communicate to government leaders when proposals fail to meet standards for LGBTQ equality, and serve as a resource for constituents who want to bring LGBTQ-related issues to city government but hesitate in fear of dismissal or misunderstanding. The appointed individuals would collaborate alongside the city\u2019s existing LGBTQ Commission, its selected Chairperson, as well as the Liaison Officer within the Baltimore City Police Department.\n\nAddress the needs of at-risk LGBTQ populations including veterans and seniors\nVeterans who identify as LGBTQ face increased health  risks and unique challenges in health care. Thiru will lead Baltimore in conjunction with the Veterans\u2019 Commission to collect data on LGBTQ veterans and provide them with the appropriate health benefits and services. He will also employ legal experts to aid veterans who were wrongfully subject to discrimination during service or the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy upon discharge.\nThiru will also strive to aid Baltimore\u2019s LGBTQ population, who are more prone to health issues and suffer from rising housing costs. He will prompt the LGBTQ Commission and LGBTQ Liaison in the Executive Office to advocate on behalf of the senior LGBTQ population, push for affordable housing options, and inform senior-care facility managers, employees, and residents of relevant anti-discrimination laws.\nProtect transgender citizens from crime and discriminatory enforcement\nThe nationwide surge in violent hate crimes against the  transgender community is both heartbreaking and unacceptable. Baltimore has seen multiple incidents of transphobic related violence. Thiru will work with the LGBTQ Commission Chairperson, the LGBTQ Liaison to the Executive Office, and LGBTQ Liaison Officer to bolster relationships between law enforcement and the transgender community. Further measures include 1) requiring the LGBTQ Officer to submit statistics and reports on LBGTQ-related crimes to the Mayor\u2019s Office, 2) monitoring the Police Department\u2019s fulfillment of and training related to Policy 720 (2018 draft here) and 3) incorporating recruitment of LGBTQ individuals into Baltimore\u2019s police force within crime policy proposals and halting discriminatory practices such as unnecessary trespass and loitering arrests.\nImprove and expand health services for members of the LGBTQ community\nMental Health\nLGBTQ individuals, especially youth, are more  than  twice as likely to suffer from a mental health condition compared to non-LGBTQ identifying individuals. Thiru will provide more accessible and affordable mental health services tailored to the LGBTQ community under a new mental health program within the Baltimore City Health Department. This initiative will create a new LGBTQ- specific mental health hotline and foster partnerships with school counselors and youth centers/organizations to provide mental health resources where currently insufficient.\nAppropriate/Inclusive Treatment and Care\nOften a doctor\u2019s office can be an uncomfortable and vulnerable space for LGBTQ individuals. Thiru will encourage efforts to provide inclusive medical care to members of the LGBTQ community, following models similar to Johns Hopkins\u2019 \u201cEmbracing the Rainbow\u201d program. These initiatives will encourage respectful communication between LGBTQ patients and medical professionals, and emphasize training focused on gender-neutral questioning and non-binary options to medical inquiries.\n\nPartnerships with Health Professionals\nInstitutions such as the Baltimore City Health Department the Mayor\u2019s Office of Human Services will partner with local healthcare providers, state and federal agencies, and community groups to promote LGBTQ health and foster efficient collaboration. Health issues such as HIV prevention and treatment will receive particular attention.\n\nBroaden LGBTQ Commission\u2019s responsibilities to include training and privacy-sensitive data collection for evidence-based policy making\nIn early 2018, Baltimore City passed an executive o   rder to create a city-sponsored LGBTQ Commission, which comprises 15 community members who offer insights and recommendations to promote the prosperity of LGBTQ Baltimoreans. This executive order was a vital decision to further equality-driven policymaking, but there is more we can do to integrate and support the Commission. Thiru would expand its responsibilities, while ensuring access to required resources.

To some, they are an unfortunate marker of a city led by complicit politicians and failing schools that do not provide people, youth especially, with meaningful job opportunities and career advancement pathways. For others, they represent a menacing presence that deters them from bringing their families downtown. At a different time in Baltimore\u2019s history, these squeegee workers would not pose such a challenge to residents and elected officials. However, with record violence, they are an ever-present reminder that Baltimore\u2019s leaders are failing to connect the dots and support the individuals who may need it most.\n\nWe know that interactions between drivers and squeegee boys  can turn aggressive. In January 2020, we saw the heart-wrenching video of a man senselessly beaten by squeegee boys on the corner of President and Lombard. Not only do commuters feel threatened, but squeegee boys also put themselves into danger darting in between busy traffic. In October of 2018, a ten-year-old squeegee boy was injured after being struck by a car; in 1986, a fourteen-year-old squeegee boy was fatally hit by a vehicle. City Hall has yet to move the needle in a way that instills confidence that we can avoid another tragedy \u2014 we don\u2019t need another incident to learn from our past.\n\nSqueegeeing emerges from the complex problems that have  plagued Baltimore for generations: a lack of economic opportunity, unaccountability in our broken schools, a sweeping opioid epidemic, and rampant crime that disproportionately affects black and brown communities. Getting individuals off the streets and into well- paying jobs, as well as connecting them to the resources they need, will require a comprehensive approach.\n\nIdentify What Drives Individuals to Squeegeeing\n\nSqueegee boys are not one monolithic group. These individuals  have unique motivations and needs that prompt their decision to turn to squeegeeing. Thiru and his team see three distinct categories of individuals and realize each will require a personalized engagement strategy:\n\nThose who squeegee to provide for themselves and their families\n\nThose who squeegee and are themselves struggling with addiction or mental illness or come from backgrounds impacted by substance abuse\n\nThose who will attempt to continue squeegeeing regardless of diversion attempts\n\nBaltimore\u2019s existing programming and services are disjointed  and do not sufficiently provide the wraparound care that will lead to sustainable outcomes. To best engage with squeegee workers, we need to personally meet them where they are. Squeegeeing is limited to the few corners with the highest traffic volume. Our team went to the street corners, collected anecdotal evidence, and spoke with these young people, realizing that squeegeeing primarily occurs on fourteen corners:\n\nMap of Top Squeegee Locations as identified by the Thiru for Baltimore Team", "start_char_idx": 26608, "end_char_idx": 30024, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48dcb5ec-0276-40e6-b0cf-a5cd2db9bf8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "48dcb5ec-0276-40e6-b0cf-a5cd2db9bf8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c53a7e6b-208e-4712-8cc2-809ca6cb3c97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ede9b02b243a0fedabbb87b9f6cae06c0bafc31e8101c6347704b2de376e7b31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b78288c4-12f0-4011-851d-c873d87a69dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "d1e9857a0c5c82915816a21b1aed450df1d8060025da4d6e02bf17c44a06730c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fbe5c5e-2e76-4acf-bb28-583689f1d994", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9998fbc4834139148008f77f9b1ed628c5f41b5656c08a4d11e8282e72944f56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As mayor, Vignarajah pledges to:\n\nEnsure squeegee boys are aptly connected to pathways to advance their education or gain secure employment with advancement opportunities\n\nRecognize squeegee boys with addiction, mental illness and/or homelessness limitations that require health, addiction, housing, or job placement services and promptly facilitate access to those programs\n\nIn unique cases, where individuals will continue to turn to squeegeeing regardless of alternative options, take the tools of their trade to raise the cost of doing business\n\nCreate Alternative Work Programs that Compete with the Benefits of Squeegeeing\n\nFacilitate Job Interviews Between Squeegee Boys and Local Businesses\nCity leaders cannot pretend that creating a stable nine-to-five  job that pays $15 an hour, before taxes, can ever compete with the perks of being a squeegee boy. We must acknowledge that they can in some instances make\n$30 to $50 an hour, can come and go as they please, and  report to no one but themselves. Nevertheless, we must present an alternative employment opportunity that is attractive to these young people.\n\nThiru has already started partnering with local businesses  to provide squeegee boys with secure employment and in turn, advancement opportunities. Thiru will hire liaisons to assist squeegee boys interested in pursuing a stable, permanent career and connect them with local businesses that are willing to offer employment. While meaningful employment may present new challenges to these individuals, it can teach valuable skills, such as how to build a schedule, how to remain accountable to a team, how to build a relationship with a supervisor, and how to follow codes of conduct. The greatest opportunity provided by employment in local businesses is upward mobility. These opportunities will open an avenue for progression otherwise difficult to obtain for many of these young men, and certainly not available on a street corner.\n\nWe have refused to wait for city politicians to take action,  or even for the election, to implement a program that can provide immense benefits for our economy and these young men. Squeegee boys and local businesses interested in participating should email opportunity@thiru2020.com.\n\nStation Unarmed, Site-Specific, Deputized Community Liaisons at the Busiest Corners\n\nBring Resources to Street Corners\nDeputized community liaisons will positively interact with  squeegee boys in their designated zone, building relationships and trust. Liaisons will not take away resources from our struggling police force -- instead, these liaisons will receive specific training on de-escalation techniques, and curate a specific policy for positive and appropriate engagement with squeegee boys.\n\nPart of this positive engagement will include identifying school-aged  individuals, in partnership with the relevant schools and after-school employment or programming, where applicable, who should be required to return to their education. Each deputized liaison will receive access to point contact information for all middle and high schools in Baltimore City. The City can encourage and support heightened collaboration between the liaisons and educators/administrators to redirect these young squeegee boys back to the classroom, while making sure their needs are met and they have the guidance, resources, and support to thrive.\n\nThese deputized community liaisons would also be trained  on identifying vulnerable individuals in need of social services and City programs. They will receive training on recognizing who is suffering from food insecurity, addiction and mental illness, or housing troubles, so as to connect those individuals to appropriate experts and resources. This will take the form of Seattle\u2019s Law Enforcement Diversion Programs (LEAD) which provides a credible alternative to booking individuals with behavioral health needs for low-level offenses. Instead of creating criminal entanglements, LEAD diverts these individuals to community-based interventions including housing, addiction, mental illness and health services.\n\nRaise the Cost of Doing Business\nBaltimore\u2019s squeegee boys are making calculations on  how to make ends meet. Some will not be receptive to alternative job opportunities because of the lucrative cash flow squeegeeing provides. That being said, we need to change the calculation by not only introducing consistent and favorable options for skill development and upward mobility, but also by increasing the cost of doing business in the streets by confiscating the tools of their trade.

The illegal trade contributes to record violence while depriving taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars. The illegal street market operates unimpeded as police and prosecutors publicly squabble about whether to enforce current laws, even as street marijuana is increasingly laced with fentanyl and K-2. Medical cannabis is booming but cannot be taxed and has virtually no licensed distributors of color.\nBottom line: a billion dollars is spent on cannabis products  each year, which largely ends up in the monopoly hands of untaxed licenses and violent gangs and drug organizations.\nThis is the worst of all worlds. Violence is unabated; avoidable  overdoses persist; and drug proceeds remain locked in a violent black market. Moving the cannabis trade into a well-regulated, transparent market and out of the shadows will (1) reduce gun violence driven by competing gangs, (2) decrease overdose deaths from laced marijuana, (3) reduce opioid addiction and overdoses; (4) mitigate the racial wealth gap, and (5) provide vital revenue to fund universal pre-K, finance repairs and upgrades at K-12 school facilities, guarantee free college in Maryland for public school graduates, and grow HBCU endowments. Baltimore City cannot afford to wait for indecisive lawmakers in Annapolis to take action while the City suffers from the failed war on drugs.\nJust as Colorado and other states have issued permits  and taxed the sale of cannabis, even though it remains illegal under federal law, so too should Baltimore City issue sales permits and tax cannabis. The same people who think Baltimore City has to wait for Maryland law to change thought Colorado had to wait for federal law to change. It\u2019s time for Baltimore to lead, not follow.\nIssue Permits to Baltimore Businesses to Aid Communities of Color\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure. For decades, communities of color have disproportionately shouldered the costs of Baltimore\u2019s enforcement policies. The communities who were most devastated by the failed policies of the 1980s ought to be the first to benefit from this emerging market.\n\n\tPermits will be preferentially issued to enterprises owned, operated, and controlled by historically disadvantaged business owners of color.\nPermits will be issued to distributors owned, operated, and controlled by local businesses.\n\tPermits will be preferentially issued to enterprises  who commit to hire employees with non- violent criminal records who are seeking legitimate employment opportunities.\nRequire Tax Proceeds be Spent Strictly on Public Education Programs\nThe emerging cannabis market would produce $250  million in annual revenue for Baltimore City. Maryland and neighboring states will inevitably legalize marijuana, but there is a first-mover advantage in this industry that the City should seize. In the past, residents have been promised funds for education from controversial ventures like casinos only to see money diluted or redirected to other priorities. This won\u2019t happen again.\nAll cannabis tax proceeds will be strictly dedicated to key education programs, starting with\n(1) universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old child,  (2) repairs and improvements at K-12 facilities, (3) debt-free 4-year college, community college, or trade school for Baltimore public high school graduates, and (4) funding to grow the endowments of HBCUs.", "start_char_idx": 35241, "end_char_idx": 40116, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5c91075-0df8-487f-af9b-ab38f0985bff": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5c91075-0df8-487f-af9b-ab38f0985bff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c53a7e6b-208e-4712-8cc2-809ca6cb3c97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ede9b02b243a0fedabbb87b9f6cae06c0bafc31e8101c6347704b2de376e7b31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fbe5c5e-2e76-4acf-bb28-583689f1d994", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_name": "Healthcare Business and Arts Blueprint 2024.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 44576, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b13ec2865e39548b5df07f02bfe38e38682fab46bdf96da5bc49ca1993ab6816", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8f110f4-13d5-421a-80cf-e02026800fa1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01191bcea38e37f5562f5b463d2c25c8fd01fc960701b2ec9ff5fe3618fd3161", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Require Tax Proceeds be Spent Strictly on Public Education Programs\nThe emerging cannabis market would produce $250  million in annual revenue for Baltimore City.

In practice, they never have. The premise of the proposed approach is that prosecutors in Baltimore have better things to do with their time than to go after permitted, minority-owned cannabis dispensaries based in Baltimore who hire residents desperately trying to obtain legitimate employment to turn their lives around. Issuing city permits and collecting taxes would no more make the sales legal under state law than issuing state licenses makes the sales legal under federal law.

But building an economy around art, film, and music will not happen on its own.

Board of Education held out a promise. It was a promise embodied in three Amendments de- signed to make citizens of slaves. It was the promise of true racial equality\u2014not as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a matter of everyday life in the Nation\u2019s cities and schools.1\n\nThe worst kept secret in America is that our nation\u2019s schools remain stubbornly segregated by race.\nOver 8.4 million Black and Latino students\u201440 percent of those students nationwide\u2014attend public schools that are more than 90 percent minority. Nearly a third of those students go to schools that are less than 1 percent white. These are the same malnourished schools that have been neglected for decades, yielding low test scores, high suspension rates, and bleak ca- reer and college opportunities for three generations of minority schoolchildren.\nThe consequences are everywhere. Maps of crime, unem- ployment, and disease mirror racial disparities in schools. Righ-\nParents Involved in Community Schools v.

How can this be the modern legacy of the civil rights movement?\nAfter all, long-standing inequities and racial tensions were meant to recede as one generation\u2019s prejudices surrendered to the tolerance of the next. Tolerance was to be cultivated on vibrant playgrounds full of children learning and laughing with com- panions of many races. That has not been the American story. Instead, hundreds of thousands of classrooms remain as segre- gated today as they were before Brown v. Board of Education.\nThe present conditions are not transient or novel or acciden- tal. They have persisted for fifty years because we have let them. And the U.S. Supreme Court is not free from blame. The very institution that first proclaimed and then doggedly pursued the promise of Brown has, despite formidable dissents by some of history\u2019s great jurists, allowed its breach and retreat.\nIn 2007, local efforts to correct this dismal reality suffered a significant setback. In a jarring upheaval of settled law, the Supreme Court struck down two promising school board initia- tives designed to combat the risk of resegregation and achieve more inclusive schools. The 5-4 decision in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 and its companion case out of Louisville, Kentucky\u2014together, what I call the \u201cResegregation Cases\u201d\u2014marked the end of an era of efforts by school authorities to fulfill the promise of racially in- tegrated education once imagined in Brown.2\nThe Resegregation Cases concerned high schools in Seat-\n\nBrown v.

Serving as a law clerk and\u2014along with my fellow clerks, Jaren Casazza, Justin Driver, Tacy Flint, and Stephen Shackelford\u2014assisting with the preparation of Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent in the Resegrega- tion Cases remains the honor of a lifetime.\nNo introduction can convey Justice Breyer\u2019s even-handed ap- praisal of the law, the care with which he excavates the local his- tories in Seattle and Louisville that led to the legal controversy, or the deliberate arc of an argument aimed at those with open minds. This dissent was not designed to provide ammunition for like-minded allies or agitate those who vehemently disagreed, though it likely did both. It was meant to convince people of good faith, an audience seeking guidance on the uniquely Amer- ican project of forming \u201ca more perfect Union,\u201d that racial in- tegration in public schools was not merely compatible with that noble aspiration and our Constitution\u2014it was essential to both. This introduction will honor that objective. It will first trace the critical sequence of Supreme Court decisions from Brown v. Board of Education (1954) to Milliken v. Bradley (1972) to the Resegregation Cases (2007) to explain the slow rise and current regression in school integration. Next is a synopsis of the struc- ture and thrust of Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent, highlighting three of its most consequential features. This is followed by an account- ing of why this topic matters so much\u2014to Justice Breyer, to the political independence and perceived integrity of the Court, and\nto the future of public schools and race relations in America.\nUnderstanding the context of these issues has never been more imperative.

Some of our biggest states\u2014New York, California, Texas, which combine to account for nearly 30 percent of total public school enrollment\u2014face the most daunting challenges. In New York, nearly two-thirds of Black students can be found at 90 to 100 percent minority schools. Likewise, more than half of all Latino students in California, New York, and Texas attend schools that are just as intensely segregated.\nBut segregation today is not confined to large states, or to the deep South for that matter. Sandwiched between New York, Illinois, and California, Maryland ranks as the third most seg- regated state for Black students, with 53 percent of Black chil-\nMilliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 783 (1974) (Marshall, J., dissent- ing).\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\ndren attending 90 to 100 percent minority schools, many in the hypersegregated schools of Baltimore City. Similarly, almost half of all Latino students in New Jersey attend such schools, placing it fourth nationwide.\nMost disturbing is that America\u2019s schools overall are as seg- regated today as they were fifty years ago. By 2011, the percent- age of Black students in majority-white schools had returned to exactly where it was in 1968. Since then, it has only further de- clined to a record low of 19 percent in 2018, a pronounced drop to half the high-water mark of integration in 1988, when nearly 37 percent of Black students attended majority-white schools.\nBack then, at the apex of integration, only 6 percent of Amer- ica\u2019s public schools had virtually no white students. The backslide has been stark. In the quarter-century since 1988, that percentage has tripled to over 18 percent. In absolute numbers, the reseg- regation of the nation\u2019s school system has produced 4,000 more schools than there were in 1988 that are essentially devoid of white students (that is, schools with less than 1 percent white pop- ulations). To confess in 2022 that the late 1980s were the pinnacle of integration in America is to admit an epic national failure.\nResponsibility for these disheartening trends lies at least partly with the Supreme Court. More than any other organ of government, the Court has defined the progress and retreat of school integration in America. At the start, it was the Court that, through its decisions, validated both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the enforcement activity of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights in the years that followed. The timeline marked by the Court\u2019s major decisions can be loosely divided into five intervals: (1) pre-1954, when the Court allowed overt de jure school segregation laws at the state and local level; (2) 1954\u20131968, a time of convulsion and noncompliance as local ju-\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nrisdictions disregarded the Court\u2019s pronouncements beginning with Brown; (3) 1968\u20131974, a period of substantial desegrega- tion propelled by strong federal decrees; (4) 1974\u20131988, a longer phase of more modest integration supported by weaker court orders as the Court gradually withdrew from the business of supervising school assignment policies; followed by (5) 1988 to the present, a period of steady resegregation as longstanding de- segregation decrees were systematically dissolved.", "start_char_idx": 6640, "end_char_idx": 11013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44015ba9-b593-4a3c-a560-b8c78ac9ef02": {"__data__": {"id_": "44015ba9-b593-4a3c-a560-b8c78ac9ef02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 57487, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ccd41b8c-26c3-4bdd-ab36-8ea0bec662db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 57487, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "093c7aaecaaaca1c9a0874ce77fc254ad69afb7fb58f7c66c66da168b9033377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55a7d058-1e9b-4ed0-8ee8-0877585d0d58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 57487, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "b6044ee061267163c71b3c0a91f79d708bcc77b8cca0fc744c9f03a80d0f2d39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a1db962-b767-4dbf-8a52-48ad5c43719e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2984e5c6b9062fa4842bffbf0ed96202c355a1a6349799444ff37a03c15a431", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The timeline marked by the Court\u2019s major decisions can be loosely divided into five intervals: (1) pre-1954, when the Court allowed overt de jure school segregation laws at the state and local level; (2) 1954\u20131968, a time of convulsion and noncompliance as local ju-\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nrisdictions disregarded the Court\u2019s pronouncements beginning with Brown; (3) 1968\u20131974, a period of substantial desegrega- tion propelled by strong federal decrees; (4) 1974\u20131988, a longer phase of more modest integration supported by weaker court orders as the Court gradually withdrew from the business of supervising school assignment policies; followed by (5) 1988 to the present, a period of steady resegregation as longstanding de- segregation decrees were systematically dissolved.\nSo, how did we get from the clear-throated consensus of Brown to the division and acrimony coursing through the Re- segregation Cases?\nIt was May 17, 1954, when the Supreme Court unanimously announced in Brown v. Board of Education that \u201cseparate ed- ucational facilities are inherently unequal,\u201d and, a year later, when it directed school districts to desegregate with \u201call delib- erate speed.\u201d8\nRare in American history has a decision with so much prom- ise met with such resistance. Emblematic of the times was the open insurrection that unfolded in Little Rock, Arkansas. Three years after Brown, standing on the doorstep of integration, Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to block nine Black children from entering Little Rock Central High School. Interceding to \u201cavoid anarchy,\u201d President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard to remove it from the governor\u2019s control and dispatched the 101st Airborne Di- vision to integrate the school. An elite brigade of paratroopers took Black children by their hands and escorted them past mobs of protestors, all to comply with a Supreme Court decision that the governor of Arkansas was prepared to disregard.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education II, 349 U.S. 294 (1955).\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\nIn Cooper v. Aaron (1958), the dramatic standoff reached the Supreme Court. Just as it had in Brown, the Court issued another per curiam decision\u2014an unsigned opinion adopted by all nine justices\u2014unequivocally reaffirming that states were bound by Brown and that \u201cno state legislator or executive or ju- dicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it.\u201d9\nThe clash in Little Rock was a sign of the times. Resistance nationwide was no less fervent than what Black schoolchildren encountered in Arkansas, and little changed in most places until the late 1960s, when the Court lost patience with delay. In a series of intrepid decisions, the Supreme Court ordered the im- mediate dismantling of segregated schools, \u201croot and branch,\u201d in Virginia in 1968,10 struck down inadequate school choice plans that failed to achieve integration in Mississippi in 1969,11 and authorized courts to impose busing plans and reconfigure school attendance zones to remedy past discrimination in North Carolina in 1971.12 Federal desegregation decrees proliferated in the years that followed, producing meaningful integration in many parts of the country, including the deep South.\nUnfortunately, far-reaching changes in where people lived counteracted the moral leadership of the Supreme Court and curbed the magnitude and pace of integration. Five million Afri- can Americans left the South beginning in 1940, and 80 percent of America\u2019s Black population lived in cities by 1970.13 At the\nCooper v.

De- troit, for example, was one of many school districts facing the vexing challenge of suburbs with swelling white populations and a city of predominately Black students. Prompted by an NAACP lawsuit, a federal court crafted an interdistrict deseg- regation plan that combined students and schools across the city as well as the suburbs. The trial court concluded that an alternate plan limited to Detroit alone was inadequate and that the state of Michigan, not just the city of Detroit, was respon- sible for the unconstitutional conditions leading to schools segregated by race. Michigan Governor William Milliken appealed.\nIn Milliken v. Bradley (1974), the Supreme Court had a chance to ratify the district court\u2019s commonsense solution to achieve meaningful integration. It chose to construct a further roadblock instead. In a pivotal 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that suburbs shouldered no responsibility for segregation in city schools: \u201cWhere the schools of only one district have been af- fected, there is no constitutional power in the courts to decree relief balancing the racial composition of that district\u2019s schools with those of the surrounding districts.\u201d14 To exonerate Michi- gan and relieve it of any responsibility for producing a remedy,\n\nMilliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 749 (1974).\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\nthe Court\u2019s majority closed its eyes to the federal district court\u2019s conclusion that Detroit\u2019s segregated schools were the direct product of a series of decisions by the state of Michigan.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall, who as a lawyer had repre- sented the winning side in Brown, feared that striking down the federal decree in Detroit would leave the district powerless to pursue integration in the face of white flight to the suburbs, a hurdle that was hardly unique to Detroit. The controversy provoked one of Justice Marshall\u2019s most commanding dissents. Sadly, nearly fifty years later, its sentiment and stirring words still ring true:\n\nWe deal here with the right of all of our children, what- ever their race, to an equal start in life and to an equal opportunity to reach their full potential as citizens. Those children who have been denied that right in the past deserve better than to see fences thrown up to deny them that right in the future.\n\nDesegregation is not and was never expected to be an easy task. Racial attitudes ingrained in our Nation\u2019s childhood and adolescence are not quickly thrown aside in its middle years. But just as the inconvenience of some cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the rights of others, so public opposition, no matter how strident, cannot be permitted to divert this Court from the en- forcement of the constitutional principles at issue in this case.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nToday\u2019s holding, I fear, is more a reflection of a perceived public mood that we have gone far enough in enforcing the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal justice than it is the product of neutral principles of law. In the short run, it may seem to be the easier course to allow our great met- ropolitan areas to be divided up each into two cities\u2014 one white, the other black\u2014but it is a course, I predict, our people will ultimately regret.

Justice Mar- shall worried that depriving federal courts of even the option of interdistrict solutions would drain the judiciary\u2019s power to the point of futility.\nDespite the repercussions of Milliken, federal courts\u2014albeit with their wings now clipped\u2014refused to abandon the project of integration, and desegregation decrees continued to make some difference. Compared to the ten years of steady integra- tion preceding Milliken, however, progress slowed considerably over the next decade. And America\u2019s schools would never be more integrated than 1988, when a wrenching reversal began.\nThe resegregation of America\u2019s schools began in earnest in the early 1990s. Around that time, in a trilogy of cases\u2014in 1991, 1992, and 199516\u2014the Supreme Court materially lowered the standard for ending desegregation orders, making it easier than ever for courts to rule that school integration had come\nMilliken v.

Civil rights leader Julian Bond once warned, \u201cThe greatest impediment to achieving racial equality is the narcotic belief that we already have.\u201d17 The 1990s and 2000s exempli- fied his admonition, as one federal court after another lifted desegregation decrees on the grounds that school districts had reached \u201cunitary status\u201d and that integration, as far as could be expected, had been accomplished. Nothing was further from the truth, and the fragile progress to date was in mortal jeopardy. By 2001, when President George W. Bush took office, there were just 600 school districts that were still subject to federal deseg- regation orders, a number that further dwindled to 380 by the end of his second term.\nSuch was the history inherited by the Supreme Court in 2007, when the next pivotal school segregation question would come before it. It was a history punctuated by bold pronounce- ments like Brown and Cooper only to see the gains inspired by them compromised and recede.\nLooking back across the decades, it is easier to catalog the impact of the individual victories and setbacks. From 1954, when Brown was decided until the late 1960s, there was little adherence to the mandate of integration. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Court\u2019s increasingly impatient directives to de- segregate generated momentum. In 1974, however, the Court\u2019s divided ruling in Milliken, refusing to tackle the obstacle of white flight, flattened the pace of integration, which, remark- ably, peaked in 1988. This is when the resegregation phase com- menced, as the Supreme Court loosened its own standards, al- lowing school districts to untangle themselves from the federal decrees that had until then propelled integration forward.\nSpeech of Julian Bond, Lyndon B.

Johnson School of Public Affairs, The University of Texas at Austin (January 28, 2015).\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\nLike in 1974, when the Court was confronted with the prob- lem of suburban white flight, the Court had a chance in 2007 to reckon with the resegregation of America\u2019s schools. By then, local school districts were choosing to battle resegregation on their own, often voluntarily undertaking the very strategies they had previously been compelled by federal courts to adopt. The Supreme Court was asked simply not to stand in their way.\n\nThe Resegregation Cases\nThe very school districts that once spurned integration now strive for it. The long history of their efforts reveals the complexities and difficulties they have faced. And in light of those challenges, they have asked us not to take from their hands the instruments they have used to rid their schools of racial segregation, instruments that they believe are needed to overcome the problems of cities di- vided by race and poverty.18\n\nAs federal courts dissolved desegregation decrees and city-to- suburb population shifts continued, school districts across America struggled to cope with the resegregation of public schools. Some school systems affirmatively fought resegregation even without the formal spur of a federal court order. The cen- tral question that came before the Supreme Court in the Reseg- regation Cases arose from two such districts in Seattle, Wash- ington, and Louisville, Kentucky.\nBoth had a long history of segregated schools reinforced by state policy and had faced civil rights lawsuits in the past\u2014in\nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 868 (2007) (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nLouisville\u2019s case resulting in a remedial decree that was not dis- solved until 2000. Both made progress but remained frustrated by mounting racial imbalance in their public schools. In Seattle, officials adopted a school choice program that, for the sake of creating high schools that reflected the racial diversity of the dis- trict, took account of a student\u2019s race in a narrow set of cases. The Louisville school district\u2014also for the purpose of integrat- ing its schools\u2014simply reinstituted the same elementary school assignment plan it had originally been compelled to adopt when it was under a federal order.\nIn both cities, students ranked their school preferences and, in some instances, the districts took account of the race of the student and the composition of the school to ensure that student assignments did not exacerbate already segregated schools. Par- ents whose students were assigned to schools other than their top choices sued. Federal trial and appellate courts rejected those challenges and declared both programs lawful.\nThe Supreme Court agreed to review these decisions. Oral argument was held in December 2006, and the Court announced its decision on June 28, 2007, the last day of the first full term after Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined the Court. Just as President Richard Nixon\u2019s appointments of Justices Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist in December 1971 made the difference in the 5-4 decision in Milliken in 1974, so too did President George W. Bush\u2019s appointments of Chief Jus- tice Roberts (2005) and Justice Alito (2006) prove decisive in the Resegregation Cases of 2007.\nChief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Alito, announced the judgment of the Court.

To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.25\n\nFor Justice Breyer, this was controlling precedent, and evi- dence of Swann\u2019s vitality was everywhere: it had \u201cbeen accepted by every branch of government,\u201d underpinning numerous state court decisions, presidential orders, and acts of Congress. Jus- tice Breyer further explains that this unwavering history, rooted in constitutional amendments \u201cdesigned to make citizens of slaves,\u201d supported a \u201ccareful review\u201d of the districts\u2019 plans, but not the kind of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d reserved for policies meant to divide rather than unite people by race.\nEven though a more relaxed constitutional test was appropri- ate, in Part III (\u201cApplying the Legal Standard\u201d), Justice Breyer nonetheless concludes that plans to combat resegregation in Se- attle and Louisville also survive the more exacting standard of \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d Generally, to pass strict scrutiny, the govern- ment must show a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d and establish that its method is \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to achieve that interest.\nIn Justice Breyer\u2019s estimation, achieving racially integrated\n\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971).\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\npublic schools constitutes a compelling state interest (a conclusion shared by Justice Kennedy). He explains that inclusive schools combine three critical interests\u2014remedial, educational, and dem- ocratic. First, integration honors a pledge to set right the damage of \u201cAmerica\u2019s heresies,\u201d26 from the modern vestiges of past segre- gation back to the original sins of slavery and Black Codes and Jim Crow laws. Second, schools are entitled to seek the kind of classroom diversity they believe will produce superior academic outcomes for all children. Finally, bringing together children of different races to learn and cooperate with one another is perhaps the best hope to make of \u201ca land of three hundred million people one Nation.\u201d27 For Justice Breyer, if a governmental interest that unites \u201cthese three elements is not \u2018compelling,\u2019 what is?\u201d28\nNext, to prove the plans were narrowly tailored, Justice Breyer compares them to past desegregation plans and to the af- firmative action admissions policy at the University of Michigan Law School,29 all of which the Supreme Court had previously approved. Neither Seattle nor Louisville used impermissible racial quotas (which the Court\u2019s precedent had forbidden) but, instead, looked to race only as a starting point. The predomi- nant factor for student assignment in both cities was not race but student choice.

Today, they are not. Yesterday, the citizens of this Nation could look for guidance to this Court\u2019s unanimous pronounce- ments concerning desegregation. Today, they cannot.

A constitutional pragmatist, Justice Breyer pays attention to what the Court\u2019s decisions mean for those charged with the day-to-day responsibilities of admin- istering local schools. He warns of the decision\u2019s dire impact on local efforts to come to grips with inequities of race and class in America\u2019s schools. Guided by a review of hundreds of deseg- regation plans from all over the country, addressing different kinds of local challenges, each with distinct elements, most with explicit race-conscious features, Justice Breyer urges judicial humility:\n\nI do not claim to know how best to stop harmful dis- crimination; how best to create a society that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious prob- lems of increasing de facto segregation, troubled inner city schooling, and poverty correlated with race. But, as a judge, I do know that the Constitution does not autho- rize judges to dictate solutions to these problems. Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers. And it is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation\u2019s children and how best to administer Amer- ica\u2019s schools to achieve that aim.

For much of this Nation\u2019s history, the races remained di- vided. It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court\u2019s finest hour, Brown v. Board of Education challenged this history and helped to change it. For Brown held out a promise. It was a promise embodied in three Amend- ments designed to make citizens of slaves. It was the promise of true racial equality\u2014not as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a matter of everyday life in the Nation\u2019s cities and schools. It was about the nature of a democracy that must work for all Americans. It sought one law, one Nation, one people, not simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of how we actually live.35\n\nWith the unmistakable echo of Justice Marshall\u2019s closing in\nMilliken, Justice Breyer ends:\n\nThe last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the prom- ise of Brown. To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown. The plurality\u2019s position, I fear, would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.\nI must dissent.36\n\nJustice Breyer\u2019s dissent is built upon an edifice of local his- tory, a faithful application of firm precedent, a candid appraisal\n35. Id., at 867\u201368 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nof the decision\u2019s practical consequences, and an appreciation of what it ultimately will mean for the nation\u2019s fundamental aspi- ration to unite a divided people.\n\n\n\nChallenging Legal Convention\nIf Justice Breyer\u2019s first audience is the American people and his- tory is his second, law professors and the next generation of law students are, no doubt, his third. Contained in Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent are three steel-toed challenges to judicial orthodoxies that are usually just a topic of scholarly discourse.\nFirst, Justice Breyer challenges the \u201cdistinction between de jure segregation (caused by school systems) and de facto segre- gation (caused, e.g., by housing patterns or generalized socie- tal discrimination),\u201d explaining that this difference is \u201cmean- ingless in the present context.\u201d37 When a court encounters de jure segregation\u2014segregation by law\u2014it enjoys virtually lim- itless latitude to fashion an appropriate remedy. Yet courts are thought to have no authority to rectify de facto segregation. For Justice Breyer, it is impractical and unwise to rest the scope of a federal court\u2019s power to redress inequity upon such an aca- demic, elusive determination.\nIn Seattle, for instance, schools may not have been segre- gated by law, strictly speaking, but Black children were kept apart from white children by school boundary lines fixed by the school district. Thus, state policies bluntly produced segregation in Seattle just as much as laws directly segregated schools in other places. The city of Seattle admitted as much, voluntarily\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\ndesegregating its schools without a court order when its policies were challenged as de jure segregation by private plaintiffs. In that regard, the presence or absence of a judicial order predi- cated on de jure segregation cannot be dispositive either, since numerous school districts avoided a federal decree by conceding that their policies caused racially segregated schools. According to Justice Breyer, because a distinction between segregation in law and segregation in fact cannot be neatly drawn given the cluttered, chaotic history of America\u2019s racist policies, this imag- ined distinction should not dictate what remedies are available to address the nation\u2019s failures.\nSecond, Justice Breyer contests the common impression that courts are wholly free to brush aside \u201cdicta,\u201d no matter the leg- acy or character of that dicta.", "start_char_idx": 34513, "end_char_idx": 39010, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0332ec2a-a396-4657-984a-2f058274d7e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "0332ec2a-a396-4657-984a-2f058274d7e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 57487, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ccd41b8c-26c3-4bdd-ab36-8ea0bec662db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 57487, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "093c7aaecaaaca1c9a0874ce77fc254ad69afb7fb58f7c66c66da168b9033377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5666dfe-c88a-40cb-87d2-7a5820d3a02f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "Introduction to Breaking the Promise of Brown - The Resegregation of America's Schools (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 57487, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "25e28634a581c0d2e8eb35197a09a9d0fad4ae6d1525c703ff83fa5e613b8bf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d07c31cf-6cb8-420c-92d3-821c9ef019ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b824a7d6ef9e12d22358a623168486fc112318b35c64fad929679132713a106a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The city of Seattle admitted as much, voluntarily\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\ndesegregating its schools without a court order when its policies were challenged as de jure segregation by private plaintiffs.

Dicta are those passages in a prior decision that are informative or explanatory but are not \u201cnec- essary\u201d to a court\u2019s ruling. Such language is typically treated as extraneous, editorial commentary that may guide a court\u2019s analysis but does not control the outcome of future cases.\nIn his dissent, Justice Breyer makes clear his view that all dicta are not equal. In Swann, Chief Justice Warren Burger ex- plains that race-conscious school policies designed to promote integration and prepare students to live in a diverse country were, undoubtedly, \u201cwithin the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\u201d38 The claim was not controversial at the time, and the pronouncement was technically dicta\u2014meaning it was not required to reach the result in Swann. For years, how- ever, public agencies and state and federal courts relied on Chief Justice Burger\u2019s statement to resolve numerous cases. Swann had been affirmed by contemporary and subsequent Supreme\n\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971).\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nCourt pronouncements,39 as well as by numerous state courts that adopted the logic of Swann before and after it was decided. Swann was, thus, no different than Justice Lewis Powell\u2019s concurring opinion in the 1978 affirmative action case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.40 Justice Powell\u2019s opin- ion was also technically dicta but provided decades of guidance for university administrators across the nation as they sought to craft constitutionally sound affirmative action admissions pol- icies. For Justice Breyer dicta could harden into widespread ju- dicial consensus and should, then, carry the controlling weight of precedent. To give the pedantic label \u201cdicta\u201d the talismanic power to strip a court\u2019s pronouncement of its authority is to ig- nore how the law develops, how judicial wisdom and reasoning\nfortifies itself, and how courts operate in the real world.\nFinally, Justice Breyer attacks the central plank of Chief Jus- tice Robert\u2019s legal analysis, that any measure that takes account of race should be treated with the highest degree of suspicion, regardless of whether the goal is to divide the races or to bring them together. This mechanical approach to the law of equal protection is not just overly simplistic\u2014for Justice Breyer, it also contradicts the origins and purpose of the Fourteenth Amend- ment of the U.S. Constitution:\n\nThe Amendment sought to bring into American society as full members those whom the Nation had previously held in slavery    There is reason to believe that those\nwho drafted an Amendment with this basic purpose in\n\nNorth Carolina Bd. of Ed. v.

In Justice Breyer\u2019s view, while the Constitution \u201calmost always forbids the former, it is significantly more lenient in respect to the latter.\u201d42 After all, the promise of equal protection is rooted in the Four- teenth Amendment, which pledged equality to an emancipated race in a nation riven by civil war. A state or local government\u2019s efforts to deliver on that hallowed promise could not, in fidelity with the Constitution, be equated with measures undertaken to break it.\nWhether it is the rigid taxonomy separating de jure and de facto segregation, the crude recitation of the difference between loose dicta and strict precedent, or the uniform treatment of all race-conscious policies no matter their aim, Justice Breyer refuses to reduce the subtle alchemy of decisionmaking in hard cases into a rote chemical formula. The Resegregation Cases confirm that Justice Breyer is foremost a practical jurist, not an abstract professor of theory. These cases exemplify how Justice Breyer approaches the role of the law and the work of the Court. For him, Supreme Court decisions are not political, academic, or polemical exercises. At their best, they grapple with the na-\n\nParents Involved in Community Schools v.

Issuing a dis- sent from the bench is itself a rare event. It is a clarion signal that the divergence of opinion in the case is no ordinary disagree- ment, even among the fiercely contested controversies that reach the nation\u2019s highest court. Justice Breyer\u2019s stirring oration lasted twenty-two minutes, longer than any prior reading of a majority, concurring, or dissenting opinion, in Supreme Court history.\nIn the middle of Justice Breyer\u2019s recitation is a sentence that appears nowhere in his dissenting opinion, a rogue, uncharacter- istic line that pierced the apolitical veneer of the Court: \u201cIt is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much.\u201d Justice Breyer\u2019s seeming reference to the arrival of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito and the legal cataclysms they had wrought in a single term was more than commentary about the individual case at hand.

It was a charged statement at the end of a term as divisive as any the Supreme Court had ever seen.\nOf the seventy-three cases decided by the Court that year, a third of them\u2014two dozen in total\u2014ended in 5-4 splits, a greater proportion than any other term in modern history, before or since. In a substantial majority of those divided rulings, the same four justices (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer) found themselves united in dissent. To place the October 2006 term in perspective, a decade later (the October 2016 term), there were only seven decisions that ended in 5-4 splits (10 percent).\nWhat Justice Breyer feared most was the diminishment of the Court into just another political institution, no different than Congress or the presidency, defined by the popular trade winds of the moment. After all, if venerated legal precedent could vanish overnight with the arrival of a new presidential appointee, the Supreme Court becomes more an executive agency than an independent third branch of government. As Justice Breyer has articulated in speeches and writings over the years, the Court\u2019s legitimacy\u2014the reason the country honors its decisions\u2014depends on its independence and the public\u2019s confi- dence in its independence.\nJustice Breyer often reminds audiences that, after Worches- ter v. Georgia in 1832, where the Supreme Court recognized the tribal sovereignty of the Cherokee, President Andrew Jack- son bluntly challenged the Court\u2019s power to compel Georgia to honor its ruling. He reportedly said: \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.\u201d44 The tragedy of the Trail of Tears followed. A century later, Cooper v. Aaron (1958) doc-\n\nHistorians generally concur the memorable quotation is likely apoc- ryphal, but it fairly reflected the view President Jackson shared in written correspondence soon after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\numented the open disdain of the governor of Arkansas after the Supreme Court\u2019s desegregation decisions. Deployment of the 101st Airborne Division was required to enforce those rulings.\nSuch measures, thankfully, are no longer needed. A jurist from another country once asked Justice Breyer, \u201cWhy do Americans do what the Court says?\u201d Justice Breyer explained that it is our winding history, not any feature of our legal doc- trine, that explains the rule of law in the United States:45\n\nReflect for a moment upon how long it has taken for our Nation to learn the importance of the rule of law. Think of our ups and downs. Think of slavery. Think of a civil war. Think of eighty years of segregation. Out of those trying experiences and the many others that this Nation has endured, we have emerged with at least one substan- tial attainment: While we may not agree with the out- come of a particular case, we will follow the rule of law. And it is this fundamental belief that binds together our Nation of 300 million people.46\n\nThe cloak of legitimacy that America\u2019s struggles have con- ferred upon the Supreme Court should not be taken for granted. Should the faith of the American people in the political indepen- dence of the federal courts begin to fray, we risk returning to a time when the Court\u2019s pronouncements were only as valid as the weight of public sentiment supporting them.\nIn the context of school desegregation, this is not an abstract\n\nStephen G.

When two appointments by President Nixon changed the bal- ance of power in 1971, the Court\u2019s commitment to desegregation shifted as well. Recall, in Milliken, Justice Marshall suspected the majority\u2019s decision was \u201cmore a reflection of a perceived public mood\u201d than it was \u201cthe product of neutral principles of law.\u201d47 More than fifty years later, as two new Justices straightaway bull- dozed settled precedent in the Resegregation Cases, Justice Breyer, no doubt, heard the worrisome echo of that history.\nJustice Breyer\u2019s concerns about the politicization of the Su- preme Court are not confined to the Court\u2019s decisions alone. He surely appreciates that in the days of his appointment, the con- firmation proceedings of Justices were far less fractious. Back then, the divided confirmation votes of Chief Justice William Rehnquist (65-33 in 1986) and Justice Clarence Thomas (52-48 in 1991) were notable exceptions. Justices were generally confirmed with the overwhelming support of the U.S. Senate: Justice John Paul Stevens (98-0, 1975), Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor (99-0,\n1981), Justice Antonin Scalia (98-0, 1986), Justice Anthony Ken-\nnedy (97-0, 1988), Justice David Souter (90-9, 1990), Justice Ruth\nBader Ginsburg (96-3, 1993), and Justice Breyer (87-9, 1994).\nAfter Justice Breyer\u2019s appointment, a full decade would pass before a new justice would join the Court. The arrival of Chief Justice John Roberts (78-22, 2005) and Justice Samuel Alito (58- 42, 2006) marked the beginning of a far different era. Every suc- cessive appointment has produced a splintered Senate vote: Jus- tice Sonia Sotomayor (68-31, 2009), Justice Elena Kagan (63-37,\n2010), Justice Neil Gorsuch (54-45, 2017), Justice Brett Kavana-\nugh (50-48, 2018), and Justice Amy Coney Barrett (52-48, 2020). It is almost hard to believe that Justices Stevens and Scalia,\nSee Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 814 (1974) (Marshall, J., dis- senting).\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nrepresenting the right and left flanks of the Court, were unani- mously confirmed. So, too, were Justices O\u2019Connor and Kennedy, who, each in their time, controlled the center of the Court, cast- ing the decisive vote in innumerable cases. They are the only two living justices\u2014and they may very well be the last\u2014who were confirmed by the Senate without a single vote cast against them.\nJustices are stewards of the Constitution. They are also responsible for safeguarding the hard-earned authority of the Court itself. In this respect, Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent in the Re- segregation Cases was not just about respecting legal precedent; it was also about preserving the Court\u2019s political independence and institutional integrity in the increasingly jaundiced eyes of the American public.\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\nFinally, what of the hope and promise of Brown? For much of this nation\u2019s history, the races remained divided. In this Court\u2019s finest hour, Brown v. Board of Education challenged this history and helped to change it.48\n\nAbove all, of course, the Resegregation Cases are about the fate of American schools.

Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 867 (2007) (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\nBreaking the Promise of Brown\nAmerica, as, too often, statistics do. The numbers at individual schools tell an even more ominous story than the stunning but abstract fact that America\u2019s schools are more segregated today than they were in 1968.\nTake my hometown of Baltimore. Of thirty-eight public high schools, all but four are over 90 percent minority; over half are 98 to 100 percent minority. None of these intensely segregated schools have an average SAT score above 1,000, with most of them hovering in the 700s and 800s. Each year, students at too many of these schools, between the ordinary gauntlet of home- work, hormones, and sports practice, attend the funerals of classmates who have been senselessly gunned down before grad- uation. Seven such students at Francis M. Wood High School (Excel Academy) were killed in the span of fifteen months, five of them in a single school year (2016\u20132017).\nThe three schools with the highest test scores\u2014Baltimore Polytechnic (Poly) (where my mother first taught in 1970), Bal- timore School for the Arts (BSA), and Baltimore City College (City)\u2014are also the most racially diverse, and each is a majority- minority school (that is, more than 50 percent minority). The best performing high school that is more than 90 percent mi- nority is Western High School (where my father ended his decades-long teaching career at the age of eighty). With over 1,000 students, Western is the oldest all-girls public high school in America; it is also predominantly Black, with white students accounting for less than 5 percent of the student population. City, Poly, School for the Arts, and Western are the acclaimed exceptions to the struggles of Baltimore schools.\nFrederick Douglass High School in West Baltimore, where my father also taught, is more typical. The student body at Dou-\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer\nglass is 99 percent Black, and most classes have no white stu- dents at all. Only 70 percent of its students graduate, and the average SAT score\u2014742\u2014is among the lowest in the state. Its 900 students know they cannot drink from the water fountains, not because of their race but because the corroding pipes under- neath them leech lead into the water supply. Students also know that some number of school days will be canceled each year be- cause Douglass has no heat or air conditioning. Remarkably, the one enduring source of pride for the beleaguered school is that, in 1925, a young Black man in the top third of his class grad- uated from Douglass and went on to become the first African American justice on the United States Supreme Court.\nI like to believe Justice Marshall would be proud that we continue to fight to make real the promise of Brown, that for so many of us its ambition remains noble and worthy.

What are your top three priorities and specific proposals for how to achieve those priorities?\n\nAs Mayor, I will prioritize raising expectations for our education system, drastically reducing crime, and making Baltimore a more affordable city. \n\nEducation is the path forward. We need to raise expectations not only for our children and schools, but for how we invest in and support them. We will fully fund Kirwan, and we are the only campaign that has specifically outlined how we will pay for Kirwan\u2019s demands. We will, among other things, become the first city in America to legalize and tax marijuana without federal or state approval, earmarking that money exclusively for educational priorities. I have pledged to provide universal pre-K for three and four year olds, debt free college for every public high school graduate at a trade school, community college or university in Maryland, to grow the endowments of HBCUs, and to make every elementary school a community school.  My mom and dad taught three generations of kids in Baltimore City schools. They used to say to me the best day to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the next best day is today. Our children deserve immediate action. \n\nIn November, we announced a comprehensive crime plan that set forth 20 concrete strategies that Baltimore City has not undertaken that we have pledged to pursue to drive down violent crime. Former Councilwoman Rikki Spector wrote about our crime plan in the Baltimore Sun: \"It is smart, concrete, detailed and realistic. It is tough and progressive, rejecting policies of mass incarceration and cash bail and rooted in principles of rehabilitation and restorative justice. It is the plan of a person who, as a federal and city prosecutor and deputy attorney general of Maryland, actually fought crime.... The plan is innovative and fearless, willing to do what others have refused.\" Veteran columnist Frank DeFelippo said that we had \u201cput forth, no doubt, the most comprehensive crime-fighting plan of anyone, including the police department and the Justice Department.\" Finally, former Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson\u2014whom we would expect to play a leadership role in City Hall on crime\u2014said this: \u201cHis plan for public safety will drastically reduce violent crime. I strongly believe that Thiru\u2019s vision for this community will make us all safer.\u201d \n\nHere are three key features of that plan. First, I have pledged to commit $10 million to a diversion program for qualifying juvenile offenders and low-level offenses. These individuals, as a condition of probation, will enroll in skills training, workforce development, and a job placement program.  This is modeled off a court-based initiative that boasts a 6% recidivism rate. This diversion program will give at-risk individuals a real alternative at a critical crossroads moment in their lives. \n \nSecond, we will lower the barriers for returning citizens integrating back into Baltimore. I have pledged to forgive outstanding debt owed to the government by returning citizens if they maintain stable employment and avoid criminal conduct for two years.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4800, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0d3a38d-dec9-4f18-b7b1-b33f6d76859e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0d3a38d-dec9-4f18-b7b1-b33f6d76859e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da453961-4fba-42b1-a059-6d77c1300f06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "66077df5a372fe13719057ce2f527eaf5b56f94b1424f5c1605701086166a8fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0c8539a-430e-41f9-8d95-68e23fb0182e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "a547f2104e0d6ec723e63fdc32964fb8331fe7fdb3a08c75e046d1a7760dad8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a48c685-e5ad-4ed0-918c-85cdd534d177", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "711d87ca4aba856158696eaf3f7be6d49cafa51b34a3176eb9bc26db9c3cfe19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I strongly believe that Thiru\u2019s vision for this community will make us all safer.\u201d \n\nHere are three key features of that plan.

I have pledged to forgive outstanding debt owed to the government by returning citizens if they maintain stable employment and avoid criminal conduct for two years. We will also launch the \u201cFaith in Justice\u201d reentry initiative which pledges to disperse $5 million in federal grant money to nonprofits and faith organizations supporting returning citizens reentry.\n \nThird, we will bring additional resources to bear and deploy them strategically to drive down crime. This means more federal prosecutions of carjackings, commercial robberies, and firearms violations and more violent crime prosecutions by the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s office. It means recruiting 600 more police officers through a college cadet program, focusing on burglaries where forensic evidence is often potent, and going after certain murders in a newly-constituted cold case unit. And it means maintaining an anonymized database of violent repeat juvenile offenders to make sure their cases are being handled appropriately.\n\nThere is no better measure of a city\u2019s health than whether people are coming or going, and right now people are leaving Baltimore City in droves. We need to make Baltimore a more affordable and appealing place to live. Part of this will include improving education and reducing crime. But this will also require us to reduce property taxes. I have pledged to cut Baltimore City\u2019s property taxes in half in ten years using a plan described by former WYPR President, Tony Brandon, as \u201cvisionary and actionable.\u201d We will reduce the current property tax by $0.11 per $100 of assessed value each year for ten years\u2014until it equalizes with the county rate. To address the reduction in revenue, we will expect agencies to collectively cut $40 million in wasteful spending, knowing there is likely hundreds of millions in waste that forensic audits would expose. Moreover, to further compensate for the risk of reduced revenue, we will raise taxes on abandoned property to prompt owners to develop the land or to sell it to someone who will. Finally, we will seize and sell uninhabited property with unpaid taxes or excessive code violations. A ten-year preset scheduled of property tax reductions will prime the market for investment, impose a level of fiscal discipline that Baltimore City has sorely lacked, and encourage families and businesses to stick around knowing that City leaders are committed to making sense of what is currently an irrational and unsustainable tax rate.\n2. How do your priorities and proposals address structural inequities, especially those that impact people of color, immigrants, and other communities fighting their marginalization?\n\nBaltimore does not need more proclamations and platitudes, we need concrete solutions to the discrimination and systemic inequities faced by our community. I have proposed policies that will address structural inequality in a measurable way.  This will include legalizing and taxing marijuana, providing tax incentives for small businesses controlled by marginalized communities, and expanding our transit grid to address mobility inequities. \n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure. For decades, communities of color have disproportionately shouldered the costs of Baltimore\u2019s enforcement policies. Now that America is realizing its mistake, the communities who were most devastated by the failed policies of the 1980s ought to be the first to benefit from this emerging market. Permits will be preferentially issued to enterprises owned, operated, and controlled by historically-disadvantaged, local business owners of color and to those who commit to hire employees with non-violent criminal records who are seeking legitimate employment opportunities.\n\nAs Mayor, I will provide tax incentives to encourage growth of small businesses controlled and operated by minorities, women, members of LGBTQ and immigrant communities.  Prioritizing a diverse business space is a key commitment of our campaign and these populations are integral to the economic development of Baltimore. \n\nFinally, we need to expand our transit grid to reach all corners of Baltimore. I will immediately start a free East-West bus system and will do everything in my power to restart the Red Line 2.0. We will also expand the free bus lines to the major arteries criss crossing the city.", "start_char_idx": 3958, "end_char_idx": 8995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a48c685-e5ad-4ed0-918c-85cdd534d177": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a48c685-e5ad-4ed0-918c-85cdd534d177", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da453961-4fba-42b1-a059-6d77c1300f06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "66077df5a372fe13719057ce2f527eaf5b56f94b1424f5c1605701086166a8fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0d3a38d-dec9-4f18-b7b1-b33f6d76859e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "78d1f783cb43de8ad0cbdf6bd12acd33a37a93e17e065688f1f697ba78cf617c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "884c0000-6d86-438c-86c4-f5ea88ed25b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7f43661c579694ba2069e31b9727e8211f55bd4e06ea8a1b29f3fedd9f81fbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Permits will be preferentially issued to enterprises owned, operated, and controlled by historically-disadvantaged, local business owners of color and to those who commit to hire employees with non-violent criminal records who are seeking legitimate employment opportunities.\n\nAs Mayor, I will provide tax incentives to encourage growth of small businesses controlled and operated by minorities, women, members of LGBTQ and immigrant communities.

We will also expand the free bus lines to the major arteries criss crossing the city. \nOur JUFJ Campaign Fund Priorities in Baltimore City\nOur priorities in the current election is Baltimore City reflect the issue agenda that JUFJ and its coalition partners have been working to move forward in the areas of  renters\u2019 rights, fair elections (locally financed public elections), police accountability, and water justice.\n\u25cf Renters\u2019 Rights : Everyone in Baltimore should have a safe and stable place to live, including the huge percentage who live in rented homes. Baltimore City enacted a rental licensing law in 2018 that requires landlords to obtain rental licenses to legally rent their properties. However, many landlords continue to rent unlicensed properties and use Baltimore\u2019s Rent Court to evict tenants without first having to present valid licenses. This practice devastates current tenants who lose their homes and keeps housing unsafe for future tenants. What would you do to strengthen and uphold the current rental licensing law? How else would you plan to reduce the number of evictions in Baltimore City?\n\nUnder the 2018 Rental Licensing Law, all landlords are required to obtain rental licenses. I would support an amendment to the law that a tenant cannot be evicted without the landlord providing a valid license for the property. Further reducing the number of evictions requires a multifaceted approach. We need to ensure wages are rising through economic development to adjust for inflation in rental prices. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the minimum hourly wage required for a one bedroom apartment in Baltimore City is $20.65, more than double the current minimum wage.  \n\nI also support collaborating with the the Maryland Department of Housing Services which operates the Homelessness Prevention Program (HPP), local non-profits, and private sector stakeholders to expand eviction prevention policies safeguarding renters in need of short term assistance. The outcome would model itself after programs like HomeStart in Boston that use flexible monetary funds, legal and financial advice, and local knowledge to help renters at risk of eviction remain in their homes.  In addition to the services provided to renters, the collaborative would work with landlords on eviction prevention partnerships because eviction poses significant costs that they would largely rather avoid as well. In these instances low-interest loans to the renter could satisfy both the landlord and renter, and avoid costly, harmful evictions.  \n\u25cf Public Funding for Local Elections:  Public financing democratizes elections, allowing candidates without deep-pocketed backers to run credible races against candidates with wealthy donors. Do you support publicly funding Baltimore City elections? If such a program were in place, would you commit to participating in the program and only accepting small, local donations?\n\nNo one\u2019s bank account should prevent them from public service. I support passing and fully funding the proposed Fair Election Fund. I have also proposed working with the Council to enact a criminal ban on campaign contributions by registered lobbyists or any company soliciting donations from its vendors for more than an aggregate amount of $6,000. I have also called for 50% tax on personal contributions exceeding $250,000 to one\u2019s own campaign, the proceeds of which would go towards the Fair Elections Fund, along with a corresponding increase of the matching funds to the level of the self-funding candidate.\n\u25cf Police Accountability:  The Baltimore Police Department has a long history of corruption and violence, especially toward Black residents, which led to the killing of Freddie Gray  z\u201dl  (may his memory be for a blessing) and to the consent decree with the Department of Justice.

Despite the consent decree, police abuse and misconduct is kept secret from members of the public they are supposed to serve. How would you work to prevent future police violence, ensure greater transparency and reform of the police department, and enforce strong implementation of the consent decree requirements?\n\nThe relationship between our community and our police is broken. Repairing the damage will take years, but step one is fully recommitting to community policing and actively working to build real partnerships with the people of our city.  We have placed community policing at the center of our 20 point crime plan by pledging to form the Office of the Public Advocate to ensure policing satisfies community expectations and constitutional requirements, the post will be filled by a respected community activist and civil rights leader; to create a College Cadet program to recruit a more diverse, local and professional police force; to open ComStat to press and the public to promote police accountability and transparency; and to redeploy school resource officers from their posts inside schools to perform much-needed foot patrols in the neighborhoods around the schools, instead of fueling the school-to-prison pipeline. \n\u25cf Water Justice:  Water is a basic human right, yet it is unaffordable for huge swaths of Baltimoreans. The City Council recently passed the Water Accountability and Equity Act to address this issue and to reform our inaccurate and unaccountable water billing system. How would you ensure strong implementation of the Water Accountability and Equity Act? What are you looking for in a new Director of the Department of Public Works?\nFor years, water bills have been unpredictable, unreliable, and far too high. Current City leadership has failed to fix the problem. We can do it better. I have pledged to make Baltimore an example for the Nation of what it means to conceive of water as a basic human right. This requires us to end water inequities, to make water more affordable, and to improve services. For something as vital as water, anything less is unacceptable. \nI will ensure comprehensive, efficient implementation of the Water Accountability Act by conducting a forensic audit of the Department of Public Works to identify the systems and processes causing the unpredictable water bills. I will also remove barriers to accessing water bill discounts by automatically enrolling qualifying residents using their State tax returns. \nThe Director of the Department of Public Works must view the dissemination of services through the lense of inequities in Baltimore. I will prioritize a proven record of improving operations in distribution of, affordability of, and access to services.  It is not only the Director of the Department of Public Works who impacts the operation of DPW, but also the tier of middle management officials responsible for executing the distribution of services. The Director must be able to identify the existing managers that can adapt to significantly higher expectations for our public services and implement new policies to meet those expectations, and those who cannot. In addition to a strong sense of equity and managerial capabilities, I will prioritize fiscal responsibility, executive experience, and expertise in providing public services.", "start_char_idx": 12473, "end_char_idx": 16078, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ec561bf-45fb-4a26-8f6e-117b0f3837f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ec561bf-45fb-4a26-8f6e-117b0f3837f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "884c0000-6d86-438c-86c4-f5ea88ed25b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_name": "JUFJ Questionnaire 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 16134, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "21ec5efea855f28004e01a7d249dcac688cb0229122106a84799579a83fa2b79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a85107d0-9d99-48da-95f0-515fbee97e89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6a5e42e075e93c1ace71836a1c21cf8abc8dd1dfe4ee5939891cf2f6c78a2dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thiru\u2019s \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan sets forth a comprehensive strategy that goes beyond the platitudes and empty prescriptions that have been recycled and repackaged for decades.

(The arrest of a couple hundred defendants pales in comparison to the tens of thousands arrested every year in Baltimore.)\nAutomatic Review of the U.S. Attorney's Office\nFor the first time, Baltimore will refer to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for automatic review all carjackings, bank and commercial robberies, and felon-in-possession cases for potential federal prosecution.

ultimate goal of adding 10,000 ground cameras to the city\u2019s private camera network.\nClear the Backlog of Burglary Evidence\nFor the first time, Baltimore will use private grant funding to clear the backlog of untested burglary crime scene evidence, which will be used to pursue burglary prosecutions against individuals who have committed robberies, carjackings, shootings, and murders, but have escaped prosecution for these more serious violent crimes.\nLaunch Cold Case Initiative\nFor the first time, Baltimore will launch a cold case initiative within City Hall, which will coordinate with BPD, as well as other law enforcement agencies, to keep open or reopen murder investigations involving high-caliber weaponry, 10 or more casings, and headshots.\nAnonymous Monitoring of Juvenile Cases\nFor the first time, Baltimore will facilitate anonymized monitoring of juvenile cases, so the public can better track outcomes in violent crime cases involving juvenile offenders.\nNon-Public Repeat Juvenile Offender List\nFor the first time, Baltimore will prepare a non-public list of repeat violent juvenile offenders and develop customized strategies to ensure they are brought to

qualifying juvenile offenders and adults charged with low-level offenses to avoid prison by agreeing, as a condition of probation, to enroll in skills training, workforce development, and a job placement program.\nForgive Outstanding Debt Owed to the Government\nFor the first time, Baltimore will forgive outstanding debt owed to the government by returning citizens if they maintain stable

State, in order to rapidly produce a net gain of 600 officers and forge a more diverse, local, and professional police force.\nLifting Arbitrary Police Eligibility Restrictions\nFor the first time, Baltimore will drive BPD recruitment by lifting arbitrary police eligibility restrictions, including the ban on permanent resident non-citizens and people who have used marijuana in the last three years.\nRedeploy 90+ School Resource Officers\nFor the first time, Baltimore will redeploy 90+ school resource officers (SROs) from their posts inside public schools to perform much-needed foot patrols in the neighborhoods around their schools, instead of fueling the school-to-prison pipeline.\nHiring Private Security in Limited, Site-Specific Contexts\nFor the first time, Baltimore will free up detectives to return to doing detective work by hiring private security in limited, site- specific contexts to ensure adequate coverage of business districts and public events.\nInstituting Automatic Audits of Over Time\nFor the first time, Baltimore will deter police corruption by instituting automatic audits of overtime where an officer has claimed more than $10,000 in overtime compensation.\nAnnual Reports of Public Health Indicators that Drive Violence\nFor the first time, Baltimore will publish an annual report of public health indicators that drive violence to ensure that the work of all agencies is evaluated in the fight against crime.\nOpen ComStat to the Press and Public\nFor the first time, Baltimore will once a month open ComStat to press and the public in order to promote police accountability and greater transparency.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nViolent crime is the dominant, defining challenge facing Baltimore. It ravages neighborhoods, drives families out of the city, deters business investment, and destroys the lives of too many of Baltimore\u2019s sons and daughters. The next Mayor\u2019s top focus must be to end the bloodshed.\n\nThiru\u2019s \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan sets forth a comprehensive, detailed, and actionable strategy that goes beyond the platitudes and empty prescriptions that have been recycled and repackaged for decades. It accounts for the current deficit in police officers and the constraints of the federal consent decree; it builds on the crime reduction plans set forth by others, including that of Commissioner Michael Harrison, which is understandably focused on changing culture, rebuilding basic department infrastructure, and improving patrol operations in high-crime areas; it reckons with the reality of prosecuting cases in Baltimore City where juries respond best to cases where police and eyewitness testimony is corroborated by forensic evidence and camera footage; it creates two new positions in City Hall and promises a monthly ComStat open to the public; it brings accountability and transparency principles featured in adult prosecutions to the juvenile justice system; it establishes and expands specific cost-effective diversion and reentry initiatives; and it takes seriously a citywide commitment to reconceive crime in Baltimore as a public health crisis in need of acute interventions as well as systemic solutions.\nIt accomplishes all of this while pledging a leaner police budget, prescribing a timetable for action, and presenting clear metrics of success.\nThiru and his team took note of the various crime plans that have been released over the years, all of which recite similar themes and typically lack the kind of detail the public needs to gauge whether a plan is viable.", "start_char_idx": 3347, "end_char_idx": 8222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "926526fd-d434-4b9c-8ad6-aa624adcd943": {"__data__": {"id_": "926526fd-d434-4b9c-8ad6-aa624adcd943", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a85107d0-9d99-48da-95f0-515fbee97e89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e9f2f580e328a34143132930c5ef001da561baa8d8541c5789d689bfe1c855ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "750639d7-189a-4794-ae97-a7041bbdd11f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f19196962a445f3b56e033a97f1de1786105237b51e0078911fdf903046c00f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It accomplishes all of this while pledging a leaner police budget, prescribing a timetable for action, and presenting clear metrics of success.\nThiru and his team took note of the various crime plans that have been released over the years, all of which recite similar themes and typically lack the kind of detail the public needs to gauge whether a plan is viable.

the first time, Baltimore will forgive outstanding debt owed to the government by returning citizens if they maintain stable employment and avoid criminal conduct for two years.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will launch its \u201cFaith in Justice\u201d reentry initiative, securing $5,000,000 in federal grant money from the Second Chance Act, which is dispersed to 100 nonprofits and faith organizations selected by 500 returning citizens to support their reentry.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will create a College Cadet program to recruit 100-150 graduating seniors each year from local universities, particularly HBCUs like Morgan State and Coppin State, in order to rapidly produce a net gain of 600 officers and forge a more diverse, local, and professional force.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will drive BPD recruitment by lifting arbitrary police eligibility restrictions, including the ban on permanent resident non- citizens and people who have used marijuana in the last three years.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will redeploy 90+ school resource officers (SROs) from their posts inside public schools to perform much-needed foot patrols in the neighborhoods around their schools, instead of fueling the school-to-prison pipeline.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will free up detectives to return to doing detective work by hiring private security in limited, site-specific contexts to ensure adequate coverage of business districts and public events.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will deter police corruption by instituting automatic audits of overtime where an officer has claimed more than $10,000 in overtime compensation.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will publish an annual report of public health indicators that drive violence to ensure that the work of all agencies is evaluated in the fight against crime.\n\nFor the first time, Baltimore will once a month open ComStat to press and the public in order to promote police accountability and greater transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know gun violence is driven by a small number of identifiable repeat offenders, typically members of gangs, who ravage essentially the same neighborhoods year after year. Because of this, dramatically reducing gun violence does not require mass incarceration, zero tolerance, or cash bail. What is needed is relentless focus on the deadliest neighborhoods, deadliest criminals, and deadliest crimes. City Hall has failed to deliver that focus and, as a result, has failed to deliver justice to countless Baltimore families.\nAs Mayor, Thiru will drive down the number of murders to below 200 within three years. This will not happen by accident. It will happen because city leaders will develop a battle plan and execute it. Here are the cornerstones of Thiru\u2019s plan to end the bloodshed.\n\nLaunch simultaneous wiretap investigations in the City\u2019s 12 deadliest neighborhoods with coordinated arrests before the killing months of summer.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 26% of all murders occurred in 12 neighborhoods. Because these consistently high murder rates are fueled by gangs feuding over consistently profitable drug territory, wiretap investigations are a potent, proven method of shutting down the violence.\n\nTHIS DATA NEEDS TO BE UPDATED;  AT THIS MOMENT DATA IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM MAY 20th 2019 through all of 2020\nThese surgical investigations do not require police to clear corners or pursue the irresponsible stop-and-frisk policies that have characterized discriminatory approaches of the past. Instead, law enforcement should develop intelligence to identify the shooters, killers, and leaders in each of these 12 neighborhoods, launch wiretap investigations using undercovers and forensic technology, and after a thorough investigation, extract the violent organization, root and branch.\n\nWe know this strategy can work.\n\nIn November 2013, police and prosecutors, under Thiru\u2019s leadership, brought a first- of-its-kind gang prosecution to a neighborhood that had endured nearly a murder or shooting every month for five years. For 18 months, that same neighborhood didn\u2019t see a single murder. Not one. That strategy did not displace violence; it eliminated it.\n\n\n\n\nA similar strategy was deployed in Cherry Hill, where federal and local prosecutors conducted a collaborative gang investigation. Cherry Hill went some 700 days without a single shooting.\n\nThis was an anchor strategy that brought murders to below 200 just a few years ago. Even back then, the City tended to conduct these investigations one at a time, rather than simultaneously. And, for the past 5 years, this approach has been all but absent.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru would convene local, state, and federal law enforcement partners, develop a tactical battleplan dividing responsibility among the FBI, DEA, ATF, MSP and BPD, and execute the intelligence gathering, undercover buys, wiretap investigation, and arrest phases of the operation in as coordinated a fashion as possible.\n\n12 DEADLIEST NEIGHBORHOODS IN BALTIMORE\n\nSOURCE?", "start_char_idx": 12183, "end_char_idx": 17179, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69db8565-02eb-43ea-885a-77ae1cf94d96": {"__data__": {"id_": "69db8565-02eb-43ea-885a-77ae1cf94d96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "750639d7-189a-4794-ae97-a7041bbdd11f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "22f4f142fadfab17f1f00187f0072369d328562e0b6460b558144f685b89944b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5eab48ed-fa84-4888-beb4-c7c8236ad944", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee397a6c6bfe3a0189db8f327d1064eca2b0b4fca2a868f8900993ef5fd1e9f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A similar strategy was deployed in Cherry Hill, where federal and local prosecutors conducted a collaborative gang investigation.

NEEDS UPDATE FROM SPECIFIC SOURCE\nIt is important to emphasize that these investigations do not require hundreds of officers nor do they end in thousands of arrests. In fact, these proactive investigations are best done with a small, experienced platoon of city officers and federal agents led by one or two federal and local prosecutors. The \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan calls for intel workups to begin shortly after the Democratic primary (May 2024), the wiretap investigations to begin that winter (November-December 2024), with arrests just before the summer (April 2025). Rather than initiate a case or create a new initiative in response to a summer of violence, this strategy is designed to anticipate and prevent the violence just before, if history is a guide, it is set to surge.\n\nUPDATED FIGURE\nThe law enforcement intervention cannot be the end of the work in these neighborhoods. Rather than pushing the violence to neighboring areas, which is what traditional patrol-focused strategies tend to do, extracting the gang will bring about a period of real peace but it will also create a vacuum. New gangs and violent drug organizations cannot be allowed to fill the void. Rather, we must bring to bear a coordinated array of resources and support organizations from Safe Streets and Ceasefire (focused on the violence) to ROCA and LEAD (focused on addiction) to a bevy of operators devoted to expunging records, workforce and housing development, lead abatement, job placement, mental health, and trauma.\n\nIdentify, investigate, and prosecute the worst violent offenders in each police district.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will also focus on identifying, investigating, and getting off the streets the worst violent repeat offenders in Baltimore. Each police district will use a combination of concrete metrics (prior convictions for violent crimes and gun offenses), along with on-the-ground intelligence to determine which criminals warrant greater investigative attention. A new Deputy Mayor for Public Safety will be responsible for coordinating interagency cooperation to ensure that responsible, rock solid cases are being built at local, state, and federal levels. BPD will be responsible for ensuring that resources are focused not on nuisance cases to drive public statistics, but rather on the individuals who are genuinely perpetrating violent crimes. This model of focused investigations mirrors the approach Thiru led when he was Chief of Major Investigations in Baltimore City. This initiative is all about execution and depends on strong leadership beginning with the Mayor and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety.\n\nLaunch specialized Cold Case initiative to focus on solving high-lethality murders.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will create the \u201cNever Forgotten\u201d Cold Case initiative in City Hall, which will work with BPD, as well as MSP and other law enforcement agencies, to ensure that law enforcement maintains investigative focus on murders involving high-caliber guns, 10+ casings at the crime scene, and headshots. Families will also have a liaison in City Hall to provide any information\nthat can be shared about the status of an investigation that is more than a year old.\n\nThis is necessary because as clearance rates have plummeted, murders have soared, with five years of 300+ murders.

Clearance rates are not the percentages of murders that result in an arrest, because the Department includes in the overall count of cleared cases what it calls \u201cexceptional clearances,\u201d a term of art that refers to an investigation that cannot lead to an arrest (most often because the supposed suspect has himself been killed). Exceptional clearances have soared recently, which means an increasingly small number of murders actually end in an arrest.\n\n\n\u201cTo deter murders, we have to solve and prosecute more murders. Not on paper. But in real life.\nThis plan helps do just that.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor years, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) has been expected to effectively fight crime with a fraction of its full force. The Department once had as many as 3,300 officers. Before her resignation, Mayor Catherine Pugh estimated that BPD had 1,900 active officers, though it was authorized for 2,800 officers; this shortfall has crippled the City\u2019s ability to fight crime and generated massive overruns in overtime expenditures. Because of poor recordkeeping, estimates vary how many recruits are needed, but most agree the Department is hundreds of officers short.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2022, there was an overall loss of 1176 police officers, with 3,873 hires and 5,049 departures. The net loss from 2019 to 2022 alone is 329 officers. The loss of officers has not only made the city less safe, but has burdened taxpayers with soaring overtime costs. CHART NEEDS TO BE UPDATED\n\n\n\nEstimates vary as to the exact magnitude of the shortfall. There are no less than hundreds of budgeted positions that sit empty, though some claim we need more than a thousand more officers. Precise number aside, the bottom line is that the police department needs more police.\nThis deficit in personnel should not be seen as a problem, but rather, as an opportunity. BPD has a chance to rebuild a police force that looks and acts like the Department Baltimore deserves. In this respect, reconstituting the police force is not just about bringing in more officers \u2013 it's about bringing in the right officers and keeping them here. It\u2019s about training our officers to do the kind of effective, constitutional investigations that will restore community trust and get violent criminals out off the streets.\nAs Mayor, Thiru will drive a net increase of 600 police officers who are more diverse, less costly, and more effective than ever.\n\nRECRUIT, RETAIN, REVITALIZE", "start_char_idx": 20199, "end_char_idx": 23535, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50e120c4-9da1-4ccc-8603-7eba14c18467": {"__data__": {"id_": "50e120c4-9da1-4ccc-8603-7eba14c18467", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5eab48ed-fa84-4888-beb4-c7c8236ad944", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b6f97fde74c6a3c8165ec96a6b4ca07eebac0bea27113a6e3dfdb3a6f095198c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e48a554f-3dfe-4e49-8f49-04733b0ab425", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d49042f17f9d576d09a73587502b621d068502f387c48c0d62242b4c268b0e79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Estimates vary as to the exact magnitude of the shortfall.

We cannot wait decades for change. We must act now. Under Thiru\u2019s plan, we will produce a net increase of 600 active-duty police officers. Baltimore will recruit hundreds more officers, redeploy police to reflect the community\u2019s needs and priorities, and retrain officers who build stronger cases and better reflect constitutional policing in the next century. Police are not the sole answer to crime, but they have to be part of it. And the deficit of officers presents a rare chance to rebuild a Department that is more local, more professional, and more diverse, with more women, minorities, and immigrants.\nAs of 2022, only 16% of Baltimore\u2019s police force was female; nor is the police force as racially diverse as it needs to be. And the Justice Department has reported that, \u201croughly three-fourths of Baltimore PD officers live outside the Baltimore City limits.\u201d All of this must change. But change does not require strict rules or quotas. The Department must tailor its recruiting strategy to the types of officers it seeks to bring in, train, and keep.\nWe know a more diverse police force can drive lower crime and more just policing, and studies have shown that more women in a police department generates higher reporting of violent crimes against women including rape, domestic violence, and human trafficking. Here is where Thiru, as Mayor, will focus to recruit a new generation of police:\nRecruit heavily from local colleges, particularly HBCUs, with school-year and summer internships, senior-year cadet programs, and an emphasis on building the kind of community-based police force we can all be proud of.\n\nThere is plenty of local talent at our local colleges and universities. In 2015, 567 graduates of Baltimore City high schools went off to attend 13 colleges in the Baltimore area. They are now seniors looking for a job, and many of them are Baltimore natives looking to come home. As Mayor, Thiru will implement a recruiting initiative that does for the policing in Baltimore what Teach for America did for teaching across the country. Instead of a cadet program that focuses solely on high school students who are several years away from being eligible to enroll as officers, an expanded cadet program would have a dozen openings at each local college and university for seniors who would be placed on the fast-track into the Department. Semester and summer internships even\n\nearlier in college would expose students to the critical work police are doing in Baltimore and to the senior cadet initiative for college seniors.\n\nBy making local college students feel they are part of the solution when it comes to perceived problems with policing in America, we can set up clear pathways to well-paying positions with stable benefits and career advancement opportunities. This is a guaranteed renewable source of motivated young professionals who could quickly replenish the foundation of the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nRemove recruitment impediments by lifting marijuana restrictions, prioritizing mental fitness assessments over physical fitness tests, and allowing immigrants to serve.\n\nThe department should focus more on psychological evaluations and reevaluate physical fitness tests, an outmoded hurdle that results in far fewer female officers. Also, neither permanent-resident immigrants nor anyone who has smoked marijuana in the last three years can currently apply to be a Baltimore City police officer. These are arbitrary restrictions that mean young, diverse applicants from Baltimore can go to law school and medical school or serve in the U.S. Army but cannot apply for a job with the BPD. As Mayor, Thiru will push to remove these senseless obstacles and get worthy, otherwise qualified applicants immediately into the pipeline.\n\nWe know it is harder to recruit police today than in years past. We also know that applications in Baltimore tripled overnight once the Department put the application online\u2014which only happened last summer. If we recruit an average of just 10 new officers from each local college, we are already contributing more than 100 additional police each year, on top of our current efforts. In three years, this alone would dramatically cut the personnel deficit\u2014and it would create the kind of diverse, local, and professional police force Baltimore residents deserve.

In light of current police shortages, we must seek to redeploy police officers and get short-term assistance from partner agencies. As Mayor, Thiru would pursue several strategies:\n\nRedeploy school police to assist with patrol in neighborhoods around assigned schools.\n\nBaltimore is the sole jurisdiction in Maryland with a sworn school police force. While the debate about the advantages and drawbacks of school police continues, there is little question these 90 well-trained officers could perform a valuable patrol function in the neighborhoods around their schools. School officers are permitted to carry firearms when they patrol outside of the facility but must store them in a secure location during school hours. Put simply, right now, we need more teachers and social workers inside schools and more police on the streets. That\u2019s where Thiru, as Mayor, would redeploy them.\n\nReestablish role of Sheriff\u2019s Office in warrant apprehension and community policing.\n\nThe \u201cEnd the Bloodshed\u201d plan requires every available detective to work violent crime investigations. Increasing patrol at the expense of detective work in the name of community policing is a short-sighted strategy. But, to be sure, community policing is vital to Baltimore City. This is a role that the Sheriff\u2019s Office is perfect to play. Dozens of Baltimore sheriffs could assist with community policing, building relationships in the neighborhoods and assisting with local events. This would reinforce the strong reputation sheriffs enjoy in the community and would free up detectives from working mandatory overtime patrol shifts while carjacking, shooting, and murder investigations languish.\n\nAccelerate civilianization of the police force.\n\nBPD has begun to recruit more civilian personnel but has yet to move sworn officers out of civilian roles and back onto the streets where they are most needed. Within 100 days, the Department will identify all sworn officers working in positions where civilian employees would be appropriate. Within six months, those officers would be assigned to patrol and detective units, allowing incoming civilian personnel to backfill those spots.\n\nUtilize private police to reduce costs for business district and special event deployments.\n\nVeteran detectives who have been reassigned to address patrol deficits need to return to detective work. Patrol shortages can be mitigated by relying, in the short term, on private police who can handle shifts that are currently exacerbating overtime expenditures.\n\n\nRetrain. Building a police force for the next generation of BPD is not just about hiring new and younger officers. It also requires the Department to better train officers to police a diverse urban population with soaring crime and unprecedented mistrust in police.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will require BPD to develop and institute cutting-edge training modules for cadets and in-service training for veteran officers to better prepare them with respect to de-escalation strategies, crisis response, trauma and mental health, implicit bias, youth-interaction, best practices for body-worn cameras, community policing, and more. Preparing officers for next-generation policing will also require next-generation teaching methods. For implicit bias, for example, Prince George\u2019s County began using virtual reality tools in 2018, tools that Researchers at the University of Maryland found to be a low-cost option for health care professionals, engineers, and technicians. Existing training also needs to be updated with new insights. For instance, police will need to be trained to change the presumption from \u201coff\u201d to \u201con\u201d for body-worn cameras, so that citizens do not interpret activation of body cameras as an escalation in the encounter.\n\n\n\nTo end the bloodshed in Baltimore, we must break the pernicious cycle of poverty, crime, and prison. An estimated 73% of those individuals released from prison who return to Baltimore City are rearrested and reincarcerated within three years. This is a literal revolving door. As Mayor, Thiru would break this pattern at four separate points.\n\nFor the 80-100 most at-risk individuals scheduled for release to Baltimore City each month, develop a customized reentry plan for those returning citizens a full year in advance.\n\nPreparing for successful reentry cannot begin upon a person\u2019s return to society. It has to start much earlier. City Hall cannot assume this responsibility for all individuals returning from prison. But, for those at greatest risk of being killed or killing someone else, the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety will work with DPSCS to ensure that a comprehensive reentry strategy is in place one year before the inmate\u2019s scheduled release. This plan will address skills deficits, trauma and addiction, and housing challenges; it will develop a plan for where the inmate will live, work, and sleep, to whom that person will report, and on whom that person can rely for support.

The aspiration cannot be to expect everyone to turn their lives around immediately, but to reverse expectations so that instead of three out of four returning to prison, more than 75% move in the direction of a constructive, sustainable life.\n\nRemove structural impediments that prevent and discourage returning citizens from pursuing gainful, legal employment.\n\nFor many returning citizens, unpaid child support debt\u2014debt owed to the government that has already been paid to the spouse primarily responsible for the child\u2014carries consequences that make lawful employment highly unappealing. A returning citizen\u2019s driver\u2019s license can be suspended, and two-thirds of a person\u2019s reported income is garnished to service the unpaid debt. Under the current system, less than 2% of the overall debt is ever collected. Yet we maintain these draconian consequences, which only makes it more likely that a person returning from prison will return to illegal activities to\n\nmake money rather than take a job that, on paper, pays $12 an hour but, in reality, yields $4 an hour.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will establish smarter, more rational incentives, guaranteeing that one quarter of the debt is forgiven or repaid by the City after a returning citizen has maintained stable employment and stayed out of trouble for six months, one half at one year and the full amount at two years. The City would also work with the relevant state agencies to end the practice of suspending driver\u2019s licenses as a method of encouraging repayment of debt. It is counterproductive and wrong.\n\nLaunch the \u201cFaith in Justice\u201d reentry initiative to match returning citizens with 100 nonprofits and faith organizations who will each support five individuals returning to Baltimore.\n\nFederal laws like the Second Chance Act provide for federal grant money for reentry initiatives. As Mayor, Thiru will launch the \u201cFaith in Justice\u201d reentry initiative, securing $5,000,000 in federal grant money from the Second Chance Act, which will be dispersed to 100 nonprofits and faith organizations selected individually by 500 returning citizens to support their return to Baltimore. Because the nonprofit or faith organization is chosen by the returning citizen, there is no constitutional impediment to government money being provided to tax exempt religious institutions. At the same time, this would provide about\n$10,000 per returning citizen for the church or synagogue or nonprofit to allocate, in coordination with the individual, to best support his or her success. Participating organizations would be expected to maintain scrupulous records and assessments would be made annually, evaluating concrete metrics such as reported taxable income and the number of months of safe and stable housing.\n\nEstablish the \u201cCourt to Career\u201d adult diversion program and a parallel \u201cSchool to Success\u201d program for diverting juvenile offenders.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will ensure that City Hall takes responsibility for working with the courts to identify appropriate adult and juvenile candidates and establish partnerships with apprenticeship programs, workforce development initiatives, and welcoming business partners who together will provide a reliable pipeline for qualifying juveniles and individuals charged with low-level offenses to enter workforce development and job placement programs as a condition of their probation.\n\nThis initiative will ultimately divert 10,000 individuals each year from the revolving door of poverty, crime, and prison to a constructive path of skills training and job placement. Each year we charge tens of thousands in Baltimore with offenses ranging from drug possession to simple assault. To end the bloodshed, we have to bring to bear the resources we have and concentrate them on violent crime.

Key features of these initiatives will be:\n\nOffering petty, non-violent offenders a permanent extinguishment of charges in exchange for the completion of an apprenticeship program that provides skills and training followed by specific job placement\n\nOffering qualifying juvenile offenders an opportunity to avoid a finding of delinquency if the individual, as a condition of a probationary period, pursues an apprenticeship and commences a paid employment opportunity of their choice\n\nSecuring $10 million in funding through public-private partnership, to expand the existing \u201cDistrict Court Reentry Project\u201d and ensure that there is a sufficient number of case workers, with a dozen being hired during the initiative\u2019s first year\n\nExtending employment alternatives by partnering with Baltimore employers who are committed to hiring ex-offenders that have devoted apprenticeship programs and opportunities for future employment\n\nThese public-private partnerships will invest $10+ million to expand and bring to scale the Baltimore City District Court Re-Entry Project (DCREP), a model program that currently receives virtually no support from City Hall or the City\n\nCouncil.

We need real investment in concrete programs that work.\u201d\n\n\n\nCLEAR THE FORENSIC BACKLOG\n\nLaw enforcement in Baltimore has to build stronger cases. City prosecutors are dropping too many prosecutions, pleading out felonies to unjustifiably lenient sentences, and losing over 80% of cases that go to trial. To help prosecutors succeed, particularly inexperienced ones, police officers must build stronger cases that will withstand the scrutiny of judges and juries.\n\nUnexamined forensic evidence presents one opportunity to strengthen cases. Baltimore has a massive backlog of untested rape kits and burglary crime scene evidence. As of 2022, the city had 991 untested rape kits. The current practice of not testing burglary crime scene evidence is also an enormous missed opportunity, since 40% of DNA and fingerprints from burglary crime scenes match a profile in the federal CODIS database.\n\nClearing these backlogs should be a priority. Current legislation already mandates that rape kits be tested in \u201ca timely manner,\" but forensic labs are often so inundated with evidence that they lack the capacity to test within a reasonable time frame. As Mayor, Thiru will secure and allocate resources to ensure the timely testing of rape kit and burglary crime scene evidence as part of the larger push to identify repeat and violent criminals.\n\nTesting the backlog of burglary crime evidence, given the high yield rate, would permit police and prosecutors to distinguish between, on the one hand, low-level offenders whose conduct is in the past and, on the other hand, repeat violent offenders who may be readily prosecuted for a burglary even if there is insufficient evidence to expect a shooting or murder prosecution.\n\nEXPAND THE GROUND AND AERIAL CAMERA NETWORK\n\nIn a city without the resources to consistently patrol every block and street corner, it is hard to protect homes and businesses from criminal activity. A rampant illegal drug trade and soaring gun violence have contributed to Baltimore\u2019s spot on America\u2019s most violent cities list. As a result, Baltimore\u2019s understaffed police department has\n\ntrouble devoting the requisite person-power to finding perpetrators of muggings, robberies, and fatal assaults.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s storeowners and landlords often keep surveillance cameras on their properties in order to help identify offenders, but these cameras have minimal storage and are not easily accessible.\n\nAs Mayor, Thiru will provide $100 rebates for all businesses and residences to install up-to-date, networked security cameras and to register them with BPD. In the event of a crime, police can request footage from the camera owners who can consent or decline. Some are already using home camera networks and working with police to solve crime in their neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition, Thiru has pledged to re-launch the aerial surveillance program, this time after public input and with specific restrictions to ensure its legality. While the last effort in 2016 to use the technology in was indefensible and likely unconstitutional, aerial surveillance is ultimately a potent tool to solve violent crimes.

(These are categories of crimes over which there is federal jurisdiction.)\nFor the first time, Baltimore will facilitate anonymized monitoring of juvenile cases, so the public can better track outcomes in violent crime cases involving juvenile offenders.\nFor the first time, Baltimore will prepare a non-public list of repeat violent juvenile offenders and develop customized strategies to ensure they are brought to justice.\nFor the first time, Baltimore will create a Deputy Mayor for Public Safety who will ensure interagency cooperation to support BPD fully in the fight against crime, a post that will be filled by a respected crime fighter.\nFor the first time, Baltimore will form the Office of the Public Advocate, which will ensure that policing satisfies community expectations and constitutional standards, a post that will be filled by a respected community activist and civil rights leader.\nFor the first time, Baltimore will deter police corruption by instituting automatic audits of overtime where an officer has claimed more than $10,000 in overtime compensation.\nFor the first time, Baltimore will publish an annual report of public health indicators that drive violence to ensure that the work of all agencies is evaluated in the fight against crime.\nFor the first time, Baltimore will once a month open ComStat to press and the public in order to promote police accountability and greater transparency.\n\nA FINAL NOTE\nThe Thiru for Baltimore Team hopes that this initial plan can be understood as a call to initiate both the \u201csprints\u201d necessary in the short-term to drastically reduce crime, as well as the first few miles of a much longer marathon to break the cycles of poverty, inequity, and injustice that keep too many Baltimoreans from achieving the success and prosperity that they deserve.\n\nWe also hope this document fuels serious discussion about the standards we accept \u2013 for our elected officials, our police department and its officers, as well as ourselves when it comes to confronting and tackling the issues that have plagued the narratives about and the realities within our city for decades.\n\nWe welcome your thoughts and ideas at outreach@thiru2024.com, for after all\u2026\n\nWe cannot unleash the promise of Baltimore until we address violent crime.

It also offers a rare opportunity to rebuild, reinvest, and reimagine the economy and infrastructure of Baltimore for the 21st century.\n\nLike disaster relief in the immediate wake of a hurricane, our plan for economic development will require innovative, short-term investments that address the acute needs of individuals and small businesses. As we head toward recovery, our strategy must also account for the substantial impact and unique difficulties caused by the closing of schools and a statewide stay-at-home order. Finally, a visionary blueprint must aim to rebuild Baltimore with innovative strategies and propel it into the future as we reimagine our local economy around industries of the future.\n\n\u201cFrom Recovery to Prosperity\u201d is a three-phase roadmap across the relief, recovery, and rebuilding phases. Just as we rebuilt parts of Baltimore after the Great Fire a century ago, we have to address immediate needs over the next several months, seize opportunities for recovery in the following six- to 18-month period, and lay the groundwork for a five- and 10-year plan to reimagine a prosperous and inclusive economy.\n\nThis plan goes well beyond the limited proposals of other candidates who underestimate the challenges facing Baltimore and have proposed narrow solutions, limited largely to tapping into anticipated federal funding and dipping modestly into the city\u2019s financial reserves. At a different time in a different city, that may be satisfactory to some. But, in this city at this moment of profound crisis and opportunity, the people of Baltimore need and deserve much more.

In response, City Hall instructed all City agencies to reduce spending by 5%. This response focuses exclusively on budget constraints and fails to recognize the services needed to aid residents and businesses in this fight and the ensuing recovery. We need fiscal common sense that both prioritizes the immediate needs of our city and investments in our future, accounting for Baltimore\u2019s situation on the cusp of an exponential growth trajectory. Thiru has proposed a massive $250 million stimulus injection to promote spending and investment, and to support our most vulnerable individuals and communities.\n\nThe purpose of the Budget Stabilization Reserve, also called the \u201crainy day fund,\u201d is to provide a fiscal contingency plan that eases the effects of downturns. COVID-19 has triggered a dramatic downturn in our city that requires City Hall to support our community using the funds put aside for a moment exactly like this.\n\nWe have advocated for comprehensive financial audits to identify and subsequently address wasteful spending across City agencies. Correcting that inefficiency will more than offset the funds used from the Budget Stabilization Reserve so that we can expand and enhance needed critical care and services for vulnerable populations.\n\nBaltimore City boasts a stellar Aa2 and AA credit rating from Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor.

In this time of unprecedented need, it is critical that we tackle the gaping holes in our infrastructure and provide assistance and services to communities hit hardest by the crisis by using funds borrowed against our bond rating.\n\nWe propose immediately withdrawing $50 million from our rainy day fund and borrowing $200 million against our AA bond rating to (1) follow the lead of San Francisco and expand sick-leave payments, specifically for high-risk essential workers, (2) support small businesses by streamlining and temporarily waiving minor privilege fees and help locally-owned restaurants and hotels by extending the deadline for business invoices related to food and beverage taxes and hotel/motel taxes, (3) offer low-interest loans to small businesses in underserved areas and delay loan repayment, (4) ensure universal internet access, (5) accelerate road repair and construction projects, (6) install H-VAC systems and energy efficiency upgrades in all city schools, (7) launch a public and philanthropic donation fund to support first responders and their families, and (8) extend assistance to people experiencing homelessness in partnership with non-profit organizations.", "start_char_idx": 56362, "end_char_idx": 60363, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8721469d-1e53-4f24-94d6-3506e3c814ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "8721469d-1e53-4f24-94d6-3506e3c814ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7b6343e-b6da-4a20-acbd-44a674ee1f7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "a1d7b6ee7fd25c34e2f91c8ada474fe919e0cbf176df62ecc4883ba4d1bfbab1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29c31439-2a16-48f7-8e2a-8aa19eb7d96e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8f89a5d6d546febe3462cdecdf078022596bb3e9dffb0bb1eab5aa02f12deea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Issue municipal bonds to build digital infrastructure, including fiber optics to ensure free, universal high-speed connectivity to bridge the digital divide, prioritizing students requiring educational access\n\nIn response to COVID-19, Governor Hogan made the unprecedented decision of closing schools indefinitely. Baltimore\u2019s students, who for a variety of reasons often fall behind state averages of achievement, are disproportionately affected by this deficit of instructional time. Even without a clear end to social distancing in sight, it is imperative that we find ways to keep students engaged in their studies. Many jurisdictions, even our neighboring counties, have decided to turn to virtual instruction. However, Baltimore City faces a \u201cdigital divide\u201d that leaves low-income communities and, disproportionately, communities of color without internet access or access to electronic devices conducive to learning. In 2018, the National Digital Inclusion Alliance ranked Baltimore the 60th worst- connected city in America, in a study of households without any broadband internet. It found that 21.96% of Baltimore households, or 52,084 families, lacked broadband internet access of any kind.\n\nTo bridge this divide and ensure equal access to online learning, we will designate funding to pay for the purchase and distribution of laptops and internet access to families. The city should also partner\n\nwith philanthropic and community organizations to set up a fund for lightly-used laptops that can be refurbished and distributed to families in need. The Digital Harbor Foundation, for example, recently partnered with the Baltimore Robotics Program to provide free community Wi-Fi in southwest Baltimore. City Hall should fund initiatives like theirs while propelling them to a larger, citywide scale.\n\nCity Hall should also partner with broadband internet providers to offer free or significantly reduced- priced essential services to low-income households without access.\n\nThiru will ensure universal internet access across the city to not only educate our children in this time of virtual learning, but also ensure that adults have the resources to apply for jobs and play their bills in an era of unprecedented economic uncertainty.\n\n\nAccelerate road repair and construction projects at lower costs and less inconvenience to the public during a prolonged period of limited usage of city streets and bridges\n\nGiven the reduced road traffic stemming from Governor Hogan\u2019s stay at home order, City Hall has an opportunity to address top-level issues in our transit system: filling potholes, moving forward with traffic light synchronization, and conducting road repairs. While we have released our broader transit plan of substantial, longer-term investments to build an equitable and green transit grid, there is immediate work to be done. City Hall should use borrowed funds to bolster the Department of Transportation\u2019s efforts and hire locally.\n\nCleanStat is one of CitiStat\u2019s initiatives to track the progress of the Department of Public Works, the Department of Transportation, the Code Enforcement team from the Department of Housing, and Bmore Beautiful. The site has been collecting data on the headway made as a part of Mayor Young\u2019s 50-Day Pothole Challenge, which was launched on February 12, 2020. The program set a goal to fill 5,000 potholes in 50 days; but as of March 10, 2020, CleanStat has uploaded no further data on the project\u2019s completion. City residents are still owed action, as promised, to fill the potholes. With less road traffic now than ever before, prioritizing pothole filling is common sense.\n\nFor years, Baltimore\u2019s commuters have lamented the frustrating congestion caused by non- synchronized traffic lights. The city has 1,300 city traffic signals, roughly three-quarters of which are designed to operate under one cohesive system, where timers are purposed to prevent constant red lights and speeding drivers. However, only half of those 974 signals were operating as designed under the timer system in 2017, resulting in clogged streets, an influx of run red lights, and more accidents.\n\nCity Hall should invest in a timing-optimization program and Intelligent Transportation System technology (ITS) to coordinate the signals of all 1,300 lights, minimizing traffic congestion and promoting safety.", "start_char_idx": 60367, "end_char_idx": 64717, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29c31439-2a16-48f7-8e2a-8aa19eb7d96e": {"__data__": {"id_": "29c31439-2a16-48f7-8e2a-8aa19eb7d96e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8721469d-1e53-4f24-94d6-3506e3c814ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "c2f9f74c86c17fcdb12bd7668465260d5ee8abceea0415e6474101224fc5428c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "84a41d28-fec0-43dc-878d-db0558afd6e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c8706292eab927ff234809a8d0a531dabe81517ff2a67407f1be4c101f17b5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Complete installations of heat and air conditioning in public schools with inadequate systems while students, teachers, and staff are absent from these facilities for no less than 5 months\n\nWe hear our kids tell us how difficult it is to focus when they are sweating or shivering in classrooms. Year after year, we see identical headlines lamenting students sent home early when the weather turns especially hot or cold. A Johns Hopkins Study concluded that school closings due to inadequate facilities have resulted in 1.5 million educational hours collectively lost. In city schools with the largest achievement gaps, which often have student populations with disproportionate amounts of students of color and low-income students, this lost classroom time is even more detrimental. One Harvard study was able to determine that the difference in exam performance on a 90 degree day compared to a 72 degree day results is equivalent to a quarter of the Black-White student achievement gap.\n\nWith students out of schools due to COVID-19, the city has a rare opportunity to conduct repairs on aging buildings that are too-often without air conditioning in the summer and heating in the winter.

Relief efforts paid for through these donations will be focused on alternative housing for self-isolation, hazard pay, and a catchall fund for necessities such as groceries.\n\n\nSupport mid-sized non-profits overlooked by federal stimulus and minimize burden on small businesses by waiving bills on minor privilege fees and extending deadlines on business invoices due to Baltimore City\n\nSmall businesses and startups serve a fundamental role in our economy, and they have suffered severe damage from the crisis. Eventually, will be safe for entrepreneurs and their employees to return to work. But the city has to do everything in its power to help keep small businesses afloat until public health leaders inform us that it is safe to return to life as normal.\n\nAt a regulatory level, the city can provide temporary relief for small businesses in the immediate crosshairs of coronavirus. The city could also provide a backstop for small businesses by halting commercial evictions for the duration of the crisis; and both streamlining and temporarily waiving minor privilege fees. Baltimore could help locally-owned restaurants and hotels by extending the deadline for business invoices related to food and beverage taxes and hotel/motel taxes.\n\nIn collaboration with state partners and leadership, Thiru will work to impose a temporary sales tax holiday and delay business tax payments for restaurants, hotels and motels, and other small businesses.\n\nAlso, non-profits working to serve Baltimore, particularly during COVID-19, are struggling. The Y in Central Maryland, an employer of more than 500 people, was considered too big to receive federal relief in initial stimulus. The organization has admirably stepped up for the community, but it has been left behind with a major loss of revenue. This gap is one the City should fill.\n\nProvide sick leave payments for high-risk essential workers\n\nThe Maryland Department of Labor has suggested that essential individuals who have not been quarantined but feel ill should use employer-paid time off. For a myriad of reasons, that time off may have already been used up, and \u2013 regardless \u2013 employers cap the amount of paid sick leave allotted. For many families, this limit means an impossible choice between putting food on the table and paying the bills or risking getting others or their family members sick.\n\nCities like San Francisco have realized the importance of sick leave in fighting this crisis \u2013 especially for high-risk essential workers who might not have enough leave to meet an appropriate recovery period. For those who are determined to be high-risk, or who are living with someone who is high-risk, we will leverage municipal funding to allocate funding to cover additional sick leave payments to match those originally determined by the employer. These additional sick days will remain until the stay-at-home order is lifted.\n\n\nSix to 18 Months: Build the Road to Recovery as We Reopen Our Economy", "start_char_idx": 64720, "end_char_idx": 69637, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84a41d28-fec0-43dc-878d-db0558afd6e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "84a41d28-fec0-43dc-878d-db0558afd6e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29c31439-2a16-48f7-8e2a-8aa19eb7d96e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "2e6ac6fa8277b9a71e924f66ac191c1e0d47a302c4f513763c619d6a19f37c0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "187c656f-2cfd-48ba-8104-ff70fbb28980", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bab928c1f4d883981865b07e4c2eb1910cade8d5c9e843784ce48efa9678a9ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Six to 18 Months: Build the Road to Recovery as We Reopen Our Economy\n\n\nBaltimore must act quickly to respond to the immediate and severe consequences of the virus, but it cannot lose sight of a brighter future on the horizon. When it is safe to begin reopening our streets and businesses, Thiru will jumpstart a vibrant, inclusive economy by beginning to cut property taxes, invigorating key industries, increasing businesses\u2019 access to capital, ensuring affordable housing, and developing creative partnerships to invest in our city\u2019s diverse and rapidly-evolving workforce.\n\nCommence schedule to cut property taxes in half over ten years in equal incremental reductions\n\nThere is no better barometer of the health of a city than its population growth and decline \u2013 and people are leaving Baltimore in droves. This year, Baltimore was confirmed to have a smaller population in 2020 than it had in 1920.\n\nFor too long, city residents have paid twice as much in property taxes as everyone else in Maryland, which naturally deflates property values, discourages investment, and induces families and businesses to leave the city. With soaring crime and broken schools, this tax rate has become harder and harder to explain. It\u2019s no wonder more and more residents and businesses are leaving Baltimore City for neighboring counties every year. Some 7,346 residents \u2014 over a percent of our population \u2014 left last year alone. And as the population has declined in Baltimore City over the past decade, the population in every surrounding county has grown.\n\nTo be sure, property taxes drive 32.7% of Baltimore\u2019s FY 2020 $2.9 billion operating budget. As a result, Baltimore cannot precipitously slash its tax rate without borrowing from the state or federal government or without significant reductions in services, neither of which is prudent or palatable.\n\nBut this trend should not paralyze us. While taxes cannot be realistically cut in half overnight, they can be gradually and responsibly reduced to county levels with a clear and disciplined plan. Thiru\u2019s proposal explains the mechanics of how it will be done, what revenue reductions will mean, how the city should prepare for these cuts, and what compensatory actions the city will take.\n\nReduce the property tax rate by .01 every year for 11 years (.22 to .21 to .20 and so forth) until it plateaus at .11, achieving equilibrium with other Maryland counties.\n\nBaltimore will responsibly cut property taxes while improving services by reducing the property tax rate by $.11 per $100 of assessed value each year for 10 years until it is competitive with neighboring jurisdictions. Over the decade, for a $200,000 home, these reductions will save a homeowner over $12,000. Under this plan, Baltimore City will adopt this preset schedule of tax reductions. As mayor, Thiru will require budgets prepared and ratified by City Hall to adhere to this schedule and will fix this schedule in a charter amendment.\n\nEven without greater discipline in agency budgets, there are several reasons why city revenue is projected to grow as property taxes are lowered.\n\n\n\nFirst, as cities like Boston and San Francisco have seen, pinning property tax rates can halt population flight and catalyze growth, which will generate both more property and income tax revenue in Baltimore. This is because new home purchases are based on price points determined by homeowners\u2019 maximum monthly payment. For example, a family willing to purchase a home at $500,000 at a property tax rate of 2.2% will pay the same in property taxes ($11,000) as a family that purchased a home at $550,000 with a tax rate of 2.0% ($11,000).\n\nCrack down on fraud and require agencies to identify 1.5% annually in wasteful spending.", "start_char_idx": 69568, "end_char_idx": 73303, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "187c656f-2cfd-48ba-8104-ff70fbb28980": {"__data__": {"id_": "187c656f-2cfd-48ba-8104-ff70fbb28980", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84a41d28-fec0-43dc-878d-db0558afd6e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "2c6c7477be5dbfc5bf18cc9dcb33de5e66440260734e48beac185dd06a47f0ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d500d6ac-73b2-4ac6-ac2b-031e67405f61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "97faa3a39f5d0fbd571143878df9f9b926d17918c2ac55ec697ae74f4f97d130", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "First, as cities like Boston and San Francisco have seen, pinning property tax rates can halt population flight and catalyze growth, which will generate both more property and income tax revenue in Baltimore.

Because property taxes account for some 36% of the City\u2019s budget, proposed cuts will reduce revenues by as much as 1.8%. In response, agencies will cut $40 million in waste and fraud, each identifying 1.5% annually in wasteful spending based on annual, top-to-bottom independent audits of City Hall. Thiru will direct agency heads to crack down on waste, inefficiency, and fraud while preparing disciplined budgets consistent with the schedule of tax rate decreases. Unjustifiably high taxes are particularly offensive when taxpayers see consistent examples of misspent funds and fraud going unchecked.\n\nRaise taxes and penalties on absentee real estate speculators on vacant, unused properties.\n\nEven as Thiru reduces property taxes for property in active commercial and residential use, his plan will increase code violation penalties and property taxes on vacant properties being held at virtually no cost by property speculators, many of whom are not even based in Baltimore or Maryland. This kind of strategy has generated millions in revenue for cities like Washington, D.C., which raised the commercial property tax rate for vacant property from $1.65 to $5 for\n$100 in assessed value and to $10 per $100 of assessed value for blighted property. The prospect of increased taxes will either prompt development, raising the property value and thereby generate additional revenue; or the sale of the property to an owner prepared to make active use of the land.\n\nPursue legal action to seize property from absentee slumlords and speculators on vacant and abandoned properties with unpaid taxes and persistent code violations. Tax increases and legal action will not be directed at property in residential or commercial use.\n\nBaltimore loses significant potential tax revenue each year because of \u201chypervacancy\u201d \u2014 a term referring to neighborhoods where vacant buildings comprise more than 20% of that area\u2019s housing stock. The level of hypervacancy in Baltimore increased from 7.5% of census tracts across the city in 1990 to more than 30% by 2018.\n\nFollowing a model adopted by St. Petersburg, Florida, Baltimore will fight blight and generate revenue by taking ownership of vacant property with delinquent taxes or persistent code violations and sell them on auction or to affordable housing developers to further programs like Vacants to Value. In St. Petersburg, 800 vacant homes across the city owed $4 million in liens and unpaid assessments. Pursuing legal action reduced vacant homes by 75% in 4 years and generated $2.1 million in revenue. Baltimore has 17,000 vacant homes.\n\nThis plan is meant to reflect a new kind of leadership for Baltimore at a time when taxpayers are desperate for change. Lowering property taxes will not alone reverse the dual crises Baltimore faces. But alongside systemic changes \u2013 combating crime and corruption, strengthening our schools and transit grid, and addressing the inequities that define too many neighborhoods \u2013 a competitive, common-sense tax rate will create the climate Baltimore needs to attract investment, create jobs, and grow our population.\n\n\nStimulate development of promising growth industries that would become anchors of Baltimore\u2019s economy for the next century, including biotech, cybersecurity, small businesses, arts & music, cannabis, culinary arts, cancer research, driverless vehicles, port logistics, and tourism & hospitality\n\nTurnaround stories in other cities, like Pittsburgh and Detroit, involved fostering investment in targeted industries where cities hold a distinct advantage. In the aftermath of COVID-19, rapidly investing resources into fast-growing, profitable industries will be critical to jumpstarting the economic reversal Baltimore needs.

Thiru plans to devote resources into building up these ten high-potential industries vital to Baltimore\u2019s future:\n\nBiotechnology and Health Care\n\nFew cities in the world boast world class institutional anchors like Johns Hopkins and the National Institutes of Health. In addition to the rich tradition of research and ingenuity that defines both institutions, Baltimore also already has a blossoming entrepreneurial culture. Coupled with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the University of Maryland, and UMBC, Baltimore\u2019s promise is limitless. To stimulate the biotech and healthcare industries in Baltimore, Thiru will lower taxes for biotech companies and invest in city-owned affordable incubator centers, located near prominent universities and research and development facilities, for biotech startups. This will include the city-subsidized expansions of AccelerateBaltimore and ETC Baltimore.\n\nCybersecurity and Coding\n\nCybersecurity is already emerging as a massively profitable strength for Baltimore. Several startups with meteoric trajectories have headquarters at Port Covington. U.S. cyber command is located at Fort Meade, just eighteen miles south of Baltimore City; and graduate programs in and around Baltimore have been educating the next generation of cybersecurity analysts and experts \u2013 creating an important talent pool for local employers. As mayor, Thiru will encourage and incentivize businesses and startups to find their home in Baltimore.\n\nSmall Businesses and Entrepreneurship\n\nSmall businesses comprise the backbone of any successful city. Especially in the wake of COVID-19, small business owners and employees need more support than ever before. To work towards rebuilding after the pandemic, Thiru pledges to introduce low-interest rainy-day loans and tax credits to owners, while organizing the philanthropic community\u2019s resources to operations that need assistance getting back on their feet.\n\nSmall businesses will struggle with liquidity both during and after the crisis, leaving many in the unenviable position of cutting costs and reducing payroll. Though the federal government has set up targeted loans through the Small Business Administration and Federal Main Street Business Lending Program, these time-intensive resources likely may prove \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d in reaching our business owners. Baltimore City must do all it can now to protect its small business sector. In the short term, Baltimore should follow the lead of cities like Chicago, who partnered with local Community Development Finance Institutions to provide $100 million in low-interest small business loans directly targeting historically under-resourced communities.\n\nThrough partnerships and mechanisms like public entity and city government funds, City Hall can amplify and match philanthropic and private relief.\n\nEven after the crisis, businesses may struggle to reopen their doors. On average, small businesses only have 27 days cash-on-hand \u2013 a number likely lower after the stress of COVID-\n19. The city should ensure that loan repayment does not inhibit business\u2019 ability to recover by allowing delayed repayments until the crisis has subsided. Additionally, Baltimore has a number of innovative microfinance programs to support small business growth and development; the mayor should work directly with these organizations to help promote their efforts and facilitate their ability to reach businesses in need of capital.\n\nIn order to recruit and retain more small business in Baltimore, Thiru has proposed three initiatives. First, as previously stated, he will streamline minor privilege and permitting fees that are costly and time-consuming. Second, he will pledge health insurance coverage for up to seven employees to companies that stay in Baltimore for at least 5 years. Lastly, Thiru is committed to ensuring that Baltimore\u2019s small businesses are representative of the great diversity our city has. He has promised to provide tax incentives to LGBTQ, female, immigrant, or minority-owned small businesses.\n\nAll of these initiatives are meant to be carried out in conjunction with Thiru\u2019s detailed plan to reduce violent crime and cut the murder rate in half. Small businesses cannot thrive in a city with 348 homicides a year. To specifically help small business owners, their employees, and consumers, Thiru has pledged to provide incentives to purchase, install, and register cloud- based security cameras and give financial assistance to small businesses interested in partnering with security firms.\n\nArts, Film, and Music\n\nBaltimore\u2019s rich history in art, film, and music has historically been an engine for growth. Baltimore has all the promise to once more become a cultural leader in the arts. As mayor, Thiru will be committed to reigniting the arts industry through several initiatives.\n\nThiru will expand and support the creation of additional arts and entertainment districts. Thiru recently stood with Peter Brooks, grandson of Jazz legend Cab Calloway, to protest the demolition of Calloway\u2019s historic childhood home in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "start_char_idx": 76965, "end_char_idx": 82251, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf9f7654-589f-4270-bbf3-ece6a5f512fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf9f7654-589f-4270-bbf3-ece6a5f512fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d500d6ac-73b2-4ac6-ac2b-031e67405f61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "892b816a6fc169adcd72b25452fa4628e360f1930f8c8f96878664f3721ac521", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae3506a5-cb9f-45b5-a1f7-e313ec4123a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31047153fb222db325e8bd4678fc70193d2e4e86d7efb8e08e143c15ba8794d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Small businesses cannot thrive in a city with 348 homicides a year.

Thiru recently stood with Peter Brooks, grandson of Jazz legend Cab Calloway, to protest the demolition of Calloway\u2019s historic childhood home in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. He is committed to preserving the legacies of Baltimore\u2019s many successful Black and Brown musicians and artists and building inclusive spaces for the new generation of trailblazers. As\n\nmayor, he will extend tax-free income benefits in art districts to include a more inclusive concept of \u201cartists\u201d by allowing, for example, musicians, spoken word artists, and filmmakers.\n\nFrom The Wire to Hairspray, Baltimore has been the stage of incredible shows and movies. Thiru will re-establish financial incentives to encourage television producers and filmmakers to set their works in the city and provide jobs for hundreds of Baltimoreans.\n\nThiru has also planned to lead a capital campaign to raise funds from private donors to reinforce the shaky financial foundation of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.\n\nCulinary Arts\n\nThere are three reasons why culinary arts have become a critical part of Baltimore\u2019s future. First, the food and beverage industry provides accessible opportunities to build successful careers \u2013 the industry is the highest percentage employer of ex-felons in the country, and over a fifth of restaurant workers are immigrants. Second, while there are numerous entrepreneurs in this industry who have been contributing to the cultural experience of our city for generations, Baltimore has a number of innovative restaurant owners, chefs, and industry players who are pushing the industry to new heights. Third, Baltimore\u2019s restaurant industry attracts consumers within and beyond Baltimore who are willing to pay a premium for the quality of experiences our businesses offer. Thiru will inject capital and resources into up-and-coming culinary districts and introduce tax benefits for employers willing to hire returning citizens.\n\nMedical and Recreational Cannabis\n\nThe marijuana marketplace in Baltimore is currently a chaotic free-for-all, contributing to record violence while depriving taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars. Illegal trade occurs unimpeded as police and prosecutors publicly squabble about whether to enforce current laws, even as street marijuana is increasingly laced with fentanyl and K-2. Medical cannabis is booming, but cannot be taxed and has virtually no licensees of color.\n\nThe bottom line: a billion dollars is spent on cannabis products each year, which largely ends up either in monopolized hands of untaxed licensees or violent gangs and drug organizations.\n\nThis is the worst of all worlds. Violence is unabated, avoidable overdoses persist, and drug proceeds remain locked in a violent black market. Moving the cannabis trade out of the shadows and into a well-regulated, transparent market will (1) reduce gun violence driven by\n\ncompeting gangs, (2) decrease overdose death from laced marijuana, (3) mitigate the racial wealth gap, and (4) provide vital revenue to fund universal pre-K, finance repairs and upgrades at K-12 school facilities, guarantee free college in Maryland for public school graduates, and grow HBCU endowments. Baltimore City cannot afford to wait for indecisive lawmakers in Annapolis to take action while the City suffers from the failed war on drugs.\n\nJust as Colorado and other states have issued permits and taxed the sale of cannabis despite its legal status under federal law, so too should Baltimore City issue sales permits and tax cannabis. The same people who think Baltimore City has to wait for Maryland law to change thought Colorado had to wait for federal law to change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Baltimore to lead, not follow.\n\nIssue Permits to Baltimore Businesses to Aid Communities of Color\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure. For decades, communities of color have disproportionately shouldered the costs of Baltimore\u2019s enforcement policies. Now that America is realizing its mistake, the communities who were most devastated by the failed policies of the 1980s ought to be the first to benefit from this emerging market.\n\nPermits will be preferentially issued to enterprises owned, operated, and controlled by historically-disadvantaged, local business owners of color and to those who commit to hire employees with non-violent criminal records who are seeking legitimate employment opportunities.", "start_char_idx": 81341, "end_char_idx": 86484, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae3506a5-cb9f-45b5-a1f7-e313ec4123a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae3506a5-cb9f-45b5-a1f7-e313ec4123a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf9f7654-589f-4270-bbf3-ece6a5f512fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "247344a91b70955fd1d3dfe21ef3fdd9f22e506de1facd8096b0036bc1aa3fc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55c8cf31-ddc3-490f-81a3-dd15fe9e3307", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "feae8814ff1774d9419f8f896650e1b044fd7d8b568dbb5b74467f9170be5895", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The same people who think Baltimore City has to wait for Maryland law to change thought Colorado had to wait for federal law to change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Baltimore to lead, not follow.\n\nIssue Permits to Baltimore Businesses to Aid Communities of Color\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure.

Maryland and others will inevitably legalize marijuana, but there is a first- mover advantage in this industry that the City should seize. In the past, residents have been promised funds for education from controversial ventures like casinos only to see money diluted or redirected to other priorities. This won\u2019t happen again.\n\nAll cannabis tax proceeds will be strictly dedicated to key education programs, starting with (1) universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old child, (2) repairs and improvements at K-12 facilities, (3) free college, community college, or trade school for public high\n\nschool graduates, and (4) funding to grow the endowments of HBCUs. These funds will be used only to support new programs and to supplement, not replace, current funding sources for the expansion of existing programs.\n\nEstablish Infrastructure to Manage Complex Emerging Market\n\nThe City will establish a commission comprising community members \u2013 with the requirement that no member holds a conflict of interest \u2013 who will manage and make permitting decisions. The process and decision-making will be fully public and transparent so there are no doubts who made the decision and why.\n\nBaltimore will create a city-operated credit union that holds the proceeds of cannabis sales, and distributes taxes to vital education programs, and eventually makes its reserve funds available for low-interest student and small business loans.\n\nThiru will appoint a safety board that will ensure that recreational cannabis is safe and free of dangerous additives like fentanyl and will create and communicate clear regulations about when, where, and how the product can be sold and used.\n\nIn theory, prosecutors in states like Colorado could bring charges under federal drug laws at their discretion. In practice, they never have. The premise of the proposed approach is that prosecutors in Baltimore have better things to do with their time than to go after permitted, minority-owned cannabis dispensaries based in Baltimore who hire residents desperately trying to obtain legitimate employment to turn their lives around. Issuing city permits and collecting taxes would no more make the sales legal under state law than issuing state licenses makes the sales legal under federal law. But, with ingenuity and leadership, we can still bring the marijuana trade out of the dangerous shadows\u2014where gangs kill over turf\u2014and create a safer market that redresses racial inequities and generates massive tax revenue at a time when Baltimore desperately needs it.\n\nCancer Research\n\nBaltimore boasts world-class medical institutions and research facilities that have recently been alienated from partnerships with City Hall. Thiru will support these stakeholders to make our city a magnet for medical innovation and discovery. Thiru is committed to shaping Baltimore into the nation\u2019s hub for groundbreaking cancer research. Under his leadership, we will partner with Johns Hopkins and the region\u2019s many neighboring colleges and universities to find a cure.\n\nDriverless Vehicles\n\nAutonomous vehicles will still need years of development and millions of miles of training their neural networks with live drivers behind the wheel. The hesitation of other cities, which is already starting to dissipate, presents a tremendous opportunity for Baltimore. Particularly given the critical importance of Baltimore\u2018s port \u2014 which remains a destination of choice for car manufacturers in Europe and Asia \u2013 this is a chance for Baltimore to become the next century\u2019s Detroit in terms of manufacturing and innovation. With immediate access to the vital I-70 interstate, this industry of the future is one Baltimore City should dominate.\n\nTourism & Hospitality\n\nIn 2017, 26.2 million people visited Baltimore, spending $5.7 billion in direct sales and generating $100 million in sales tax revenue. The tourism industry is a major employer in Baltimore, supporting over 85,500 jobs in Baltimore and its surrounding areas.

The tourism industry is a major employer in Baltimore, supporting over 85,500 jobs in Baltimore and its surrounding areas. However, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 have only exacerbated the strain on the industry, its workers, and their families. While we must ensure that all employees within the tourism and hospitality industries earn a living wage and have opportunities for upward mobility. Given Baltimore\u2019s location and enormous cultural assets, there are tremendous growth opportunities to make tourism a vibrant economic engine.\n\nTourism thrives when Baltimore thrives \u2013 first, we need to make our city safe. Thiru pledges that his 20-point crime plan of unprecedented strategies will cut the murder rate in half. When we see real change on our streets, tourism will rise.\n\nPort Development\n\nThree advantages \u2013 Baltimore\u2019s proximity to Washington D.C., its location along the I-95 and Amtrak corridor, and its large and booming port \u2013 make the city not only easily and quickly accessible, but an area marked for its potential for economic development.\n\nBaltimore boasts the 11th largest U.S. port regarding the handling of international cargo and is the country\u2019s 9th largest measured by value. Our port has both public and private terminals that, in 2018, imported and exported 43 million tons of cargo and is set to be the departure point for 100 cruises next year.\n\nAs mayor, Thiru will invest even more into the development and renovation of Baltimore\u2019s port to incentivize more traffic and generate stable, well-paying jobs for Baltimoreans.

Our port has both public and private terminals that, in 2018, imported and exported 43 million tons of cargo and is set to be the departure point for 100 cruises next year.\n\nAs mayor, Thiru will invest even more into the development and renovation of Baltimore\u2019s port to incentivize more traffic and generate stable, well-paying jobs for Baltimoreans. First, he will ensure the reconstruction of the Howard Street Tunnel. An expansion of the freight tunnel will increase freight clearances and allow for more transport of goods from Baltimore\u2019s port to other jurisdictions while creating hundreds of construction jobs. The federal government has already granted money for this project, and private partnerships can mitigate remaining costs.\n\n\nRaise property taxes on abandoned properties to ensure that real estate speculators are induced to promptly begin development or sell property holdings to investors who will\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence linking neighborhoods of concentrated disinvestment to violent crime, it is impossible to discuss the epidemic of violence in Baltimore today without accounting for our city\u2019s history of housing segregation. A lack of affordable housing in the city often results in inherent instability for low income residents and contributes to the rise of abandoned blocks across the city. Unable to afford a safe place to live, tenants are often forced to either settle for substandard housing or become regular defendants in Baltimore\u2019s rent courts.\n\nThis lack of stable housing affects more than just the roof over one\u2019s head. Every house is linked to a community which provides (or deprives) a family access to good schools, quality food, and a safe environment. It is no surprise that quality stable housing is linked to longer and healthier lives. In Baltimore, this difference is visible in the variation of life expectancy across the city - with residents of Roland Park living an average of 14 years longer than those from Sandtown-Winchester.\n\nFor too long, Baltimore has focused its time and resources towards a few select areas of the city. The long-term solution rests in ensuring adequate investment across the city so that Baltimore is a united city, rather than a checkerboard of opportunity. While the city lacks the funds to directly invest in all neighborhoods, it possesses strong economic and political tools to redirect capital equitably.\n\nWith over 17,000 vacant properties, Baltimore is sitting on untapped housing potential. Several cities in California have moved to tax properties that are unoccupied for an extensive period of time. This diminishes incentives for speculators who acquire properties and hold them until their value is raised for resale or they can command a higher rent. By taxing long term vacancies, the city can push property holders to either increase recruitment efforts to find tenants, or reduce rents to more reasonable levels. Property owners who are unwilling to do this will face taxes that help the city fund initiatives to combat the known impacts of high levels of vacant housing.\n\nCut vacant housing stock by using eminent domain to seize property with excessive code violations and unpaid taxes and transfer it to affordable housing organizations\n\nBaltimore city code permits city acquisition of abandoned property when the property is deemed a public safety threat and the owner of the property has failed to take the proper course of action to correct the problem. Despite having this authority for years, city leadership has failed to leverage their power and reclaim property from absentee landlords who have let it fall into disarray. In most of the incidences in which the city has exercised its authority - it has done so to demolish properties rather than invest in their revitalization or future development.\n\nWhen done properly, the city\u2019s ability to condemn and seize property can work to the public\u2019s benefit. Evidence from St. Petersburg showed a near 75% reduction in vacant homes when the city began efforts to hand these properties to non-profits, who used them to construct affordable housing for residents. This effort functions to prevent abandoned housing from bringing down the value of entire blocks while also returning properties from absentee landlords to communities who could put them to good use. Thiru plans to seize abandoned homes from owners who refuse to care for them and subsequently sell these properties to community housing organizations.\n\n\n\nRelaunch dollar-homes program with modified city subsidies to banks, reinvest in community land trusts to expand long-term affordable housing, and effectively safeguard tenants\u2019 rights\n\nRelaunch Dollar Homes Program\n\nThiru commits to finally act on the words and promises of past politicians and bring back the Dollar Homes Program. Under the program, residents can buy a vacant home from the city for only $1 if they promise to (1) commit 100k towards renovating the property and (2) live in the residence for at least 5 years.

The program will be directed at supporting local living for law enforcement and first responders, teachers, and social workers.\n\nIn order for this program to succeed, Thiru will explore partnerships with local banks and lenders to ensure that those looking to buy a home through the program have access to the financial support they need in order to rehabilitate the property. City Hall will commit to purchasing insurance against the value of the home, then provide lending institutions guarantees that their investments are secure.\n\nAs necessary, the city will co-invest to cover any differential between appraised value of the home and money needed to rehabilitate it. By working with banks to secure low-interest loans, Dollar Homes can be made accessible to residents who otherwise may not be able to access home ownership.\n\nInvest In and Support Community Land Trusts\n\nGiven the disparity in homeownership rates in the Baltimore area \u2013 white residents are three times more likely to own a home than black residents \u2013 City Hall needs to do more to ensure that homeownership is accessible to black and low income residents. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are a promising means of collective ownership of land and capital. CLTs are nonprofits that buy land and maintain ownership of homes in the city, and then enter long-term, renewable leases with homeowners at affordable rates. When the homeowner sells, the family earns a portion of the increased property value as a stakeholder in the CLT, while the remainder is kept by the trust to preserve the affordability of the housing.\n\nExamples from Boston have shown the ways in which CLTs can provide homeownership opportunities to individuals who would normally be limited to rental options. In Baltimore, the Northeast Housing Initiative has taken similar steps to build community ownership of property. However, given the amount of time and support these initiatives require, it is important that we look to their long-term value \u2013 not just their immediate payoffs. Each home that a CLT secures helps their initiative expand further, and is a guaranteed affordable home for generations to come. Every resident who owns a CLT home feels the pride and reaps the benefits of owning their own home, but also is securing their future by investing in their land trust\u2019s equity. Given that homeownership is one of the key means of generating wealth for Americans, it is imperative that Baltimore support CLTs and other means of affordable homeownership. Thiru will partner with community organizations with the knowledge that these impacts take generations to see, but are incredibly important to strive for today.\n\nGuarantee Legal Assistance for Tenants Facing Rent Court\n\nRental agreements are underlined by a power imbalance between renter and landlord. When facing eviction, tenants often are rushed through rent courts with little understanding of the system or their rights. Tenants rarely have representation and few know how to defend their cases in court, presenting landlords with the upper hand.\n\nThiru will commit to increasing public attorney resources to defend tenants facing evictions in rent court, allotting them a fighting chance at repelling invalid eviction charges. While the city would be unable to provide a personal attorney for all cases \u2013 150,000 cases interact with rent court annually \u2013\n\nthe city should provide a centralized access point to legal resources regarding Rent Court procedures, the status of their cases, and housing assistance services to halt eviction.\n\nThiru will also support adding city renter protections that prevent evictions unless the landlord could prove just cause for eviction, similar to those implemented recently in San Jose.\n\nExpand Eviction Prevention Policies and Post-Eviction Rehousing Services\n\nIt is time that we stop considering homelessness a problem once the person has already lost their home. Baltimore can reduce costs associated with emergency housing and prevent tenants from needing to uproot from their communities by expanding eviction prevention policies safeguarding renters in need of short-term assistance. The HomeStart program, based in Boston, seeks to prevent tenant evictions by helping manage the cases of at-risk tenants, negotiating agreements with landlords and covering back rent payments when necessary. Landlords avoid the high costs of eviction, the city spends less on emergency housing services, and tenants can continue to stay in their homes.

To tackle the stark inequities and consequences of long-standing disinvestment in some of our most struggling communities, which is further highlighted by the devastating wake of COVID-19, we need to work together.\n\nWe are fortunate to have scores of local private and social players dedicated to creating a brighter future for Baltimore.

And, many private firms see social responsibility and civic engagement as essential for employee retention and community development \u2013 in other words, businesses do well by doing good.\n\nCities like Memphis, New York, and Asheville have proven the importance of a shared vision of progress, where cross-sector initiatives and clear metrics resulted in job creation, a more efficient city government, and drastically lower crime rates. However, because of failed leadership in City Hall, we have long gone without a coordinated strategic plan. We need to unite our best assets and key stakeholders under a comprehensive plan \u2013 across silos and barriers \u2013 to sustainably lift up individuals and communities in every neighborhood.\n\nThiru\u2019s Strategic Partnership Initiative will spur equitable growth and drive the cross-sector partnerships needed to solve our city\u2019s most challenging problems. As part of this initiative, Thiru has pledged to:\n\nCreate an Office for Strategic Partnerships (OSP) in City Hall to promote capital development in Baltimore through public-private partnerships and to coordinate city resources with greater efficiency and transparency. During and after the COVID-19 crisis, there should be close coordination across sectors to provide care to underserved communities.\nLead a Collective Impact Taskforce to convene public, private, philanthropic, and nonprofit stakeholders to more effectively and holistically address the core challenges affecting Baltimore City.

He has already proposed his Court to Career (C2C) Program, which is an adult diversion initiative; along with its parallel program, School to Success (S2S), which is purposed for diverting juvenile offenders. Both programs match individuals with employment opportunities with room for advancement and growth.\n\nIn its first full year, C2C and S2S will help divert 1,000 individuals who are charged with low-level offenses from the revolving door of poverty, crime, and prison to a constructive path of job training and paid employment opportunities as a condition of receiving a probation before judgment (PBJ). This will require partnerships between district court judges and juvenile masters, probation officers, case workers, skills training programs, apprenticeships, and employers who are prepared to hire at-risk individuals and give them a second chance. Only when individuals complete the program, having demonstrated stable employment and no criminal activity, are they taken off probation with their records expunged.\n\nFor juveniles, the programs will adopt apprenticeships and work schedules that are compatible with school and other vital obligations. School to Success will prioritize programs geared to all facets of enterprise and academic achievement. Thiru will ensure expanded opportunities for vocational school instruction, university-level coursework, and internships/apprenticeships, making them more readily accessible to students completing their junior and senior years of high school.\n\n\nFive to 10 Years: Spark for Baltimore City a \u201cNext Generation New Deal\u201d", "start_char_idx": 104852, "end_char_idx": 107359, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbbbba1b-4b0f-4b1e-9f10-abb1d6d2ff9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbbbba1b-4b0f-4b1e-9f10-abb1d6d2ff9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22c0e247-9c4d-4748-b3a0-5316f1dae08e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "cdc7e953fbf711c5ad66fe1133bb2ffdcb03500a87133ccede70156747000594", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08e1abd7-71ee-42a8-9e7d-c9550bf7f13e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f66acf66e49aa8e4f8125fd58489af724005b5559bb52b31ac5d45421fa55e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Five to 10 Years: Spark for Baltimore City a \u201cNext Generation New Deal\u201d\n\n\nFrom forging the first leg of the American railroad to mapping the stars with the Hubble Space Telescope, Baltimore\u2019s history is defined by industry and innovation. Though our city has suffered from job erosion and disinvestment, Baltimore\u2019s potential is tremendous. We are a city that pioneers the cutting-edge of medicine, launches next-generation businesses, and sets the standard for creativity in the arts. Our restaurants make headlines while creating community. We welcome immigrants while celebrating businesses that have thrived in Baltimore for generations. Baltimore has nearly 14,000 businesses, both big and small; and one third of our labor force \u2013 one of the highest percentages in the country \u2013 devotes their careers to service through the nonprofit sector. We are a city shaped by individuals dedicated to the promise of progress.\n\nThiru will offer Baltimore a New Deal for the next generation by injecting a massive stimulus investment, redesigning our transit network and water \u2013 sewage system, rebuilding our crumbling schools, and leading the nation in smart city innovations. This \u201cNext Generation New Deal\u201d will help unleash our city\u2019s full promise, a promise of prosperity and equity, hope and opportunity.\n\nLaunch massive $3-4 billion investment in infrastructure overhaul over the next decade, pledging to match federal stimulus funds with public-private city investments for five major commitments.\n\nAs Baltimore ushers in a new era of economic development, City Hall must begin a second round of infrastructure investments. Thiru has pledged to match federal stimulus funds granted to the city by again borrowing against the city\u2019s AA municipal bond rating, this time a sum of $3.5 billion, to invest over a five \u2013 10-year period. This will be supplemented by leveraging philanthropic partnerships and coordinating with investors and businesses.\n\nThe funds will go towards five major initiatives: (1) the design and construction of a green transit network, (2) building a water/waste system that is in compliance with the federal consent decree, (3) launching massive renovations of city schools, (4) constructing an equitable transit grid, and (5) beginning smart city investments.\n\nMajor public transit initiatives to potentially include East-West light rail, revitalized trolley cars, Inner Harbor footbridge, above-ground circular shuttle train, and high-speed rail to DC\n\nDue to necessary social distancing guidelines, Baltimore\u2019s transit system has significantly decreased its operations by limiting lines and routes. Once the COVID-19 crisis subsides, Thiru will work with state and local transit authorities to restore Baltimore\u2019s transit system to greater capacity than before the public health crisis, creating an equitable transit grid while also offering an array of new employment opportunities at all levels.\n\nThiru will prioritize two major public works projects: expanding free circulator routes to include major west-to-east corridors and critical arteries to historically disinvested neighborhoods; and leading the charge to build the primary route of America\u2019s first high-speed rail line, connecting Baltimore and Washington, D.C. These projects will lay the groundwork for the exploration of other transit alternatives, from a revitalized trolley car system to an above ground circulator to gondolas to a footbridge across the harbor.\n\nThe city's free transit system\u2014the Charm City Circulator\u2014is designed by Visit Baltimore, which is a 501c6 with municipal and corporate partners, designed specifically to market the city\u2014not to provide widespread\npublic transit. We need to reform the purpose of free-fare buses to specifically target riders who lack alternative transit options. Expanding free circulator routes to East-West corridors and major arterial roadways like Pennsylvania Avenue and Harford Road will reduce pollution as ridership increases, reduce commute times, make the City more accessible, and facilitate economic development by providing realistic transportation to job centers and employers. Economic empowerment through transit is critical to Baltimore, which suffers higher unemployment rates than neighboring jurisdictions. Thiru will lobby to start construction of the proposed 14-mile East-West transit line between Baltimore County and downtown, connecting the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC train and instituting a comprehensive transit grid.\n\nThiru will lead the fight to break ground on the first American leg of high-speed rail connecting DC and Baltimore with a 13-minute bullet train, guaranteeing substantially discounted commuter fares based on income, and induce competitive, international bidding to reduce overall project costs.", "start_char_idx": 107288, "end_char_idx": 112077, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08e1abd7-71ee-42a8-9e7d-c9550bf7f13e": {"__data__": {"id_": "08e1abd7-71ee-42a8-9e7d-c9550bf7f13e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbbbba1b-4b0f-4b1e-9f10-abb1d6d2ff9e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "49cd4c24b026083e3cc3fa594b0c4541c5c9756b614d41e4ad56ff229c478844", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "758360a3-fe3b-4e83-ac9c-883319bf7510", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee910b7fc76f93c03a4bdd74c90350d4f445b1aa6731ab4428ed8c349ae86ee0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rebuild green network of roads and bridges, which are currently at risk of collapsing, with dedicated thoroughfares for public transit, combined with bike lanes and completion of 35-mile Gwynn Falls and Herring Run trail loop\nThiru will execute a Complete Streets redesign that considers the racial and socioeconomic equity of our roads and bridges.

We will use sensors attached to city-owned vehicles, which naturally traverse the city, to measure width, depth, and severity of potholes; and then log that data into a publicly-available system. This monitoring serves as a measure of accountability, ensuring that the public can track and visualize the completion of 311 calls and that the most severe and significant potholes are filled first.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s current water billing system is inherently flawed, and notoriously issues exorbitantly high bills to residents resulting from undetected, yet often preventable, leaks. When a resident sees a high bill and calls in to complain, the Department of Public Works (DPW) examines hourly water usage; if the meter is constantly running all day and all night long, DPW naturally concludes there may be a leak, big or small, and then takes action. But there is no reason DPW should wait for residents to call-in about data DPW already has in its possession. As mayor, Thiru will implement computer monitoring of hourly meter rates to detect sudden spikes in usage or constant water flow that are symptoms of water leaks. Leaks left undetected and unattended, combined with crumbling infrastructure, have direct consequences \u2013 like Poe Homes being left without water for weeks, and recurring stories about sinkholes developing in and around our city. Catching leaks early and taking steps to fix them will reduce costs for the city, save families money, and lower the risk of catastrophic water main breaks.\n\nThiru will lead the effort for universal fiber optic internet infrastructure made free for public consumption. He will initiate competitive bidding among providers before laying the groundwork to ensure coverage in all neighborhoods, making Baltimore the national leader in internet accessibility.\n\nSmart technology can be designed to serve two purposes: to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability, and to reduce operation costs. Thiru will install LED bulbs into streetlights, which can be dimmed and brightened in accordance with data on location, weather, and time of day. City Hall will also prioritize research and data collection on air pollution and waste management in order to develop the cleanest possible policies and procedures.\n\nA FINAL NOTE\n\nWe will make Baltimore all it can be by building an economy that works for all of us \u2013 in all neighborhoods, across all walks of life. Acting on this clear, inclusive vision is exponentially more important as we enter a period of economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our campaign knows that low-income and minority communities are hit harder by the virus, and will face the brunt of the economic challenges it brings. Implementing long-term investments through these three-phase initiatives will directly support those most impacted by the crisis in the short-term, while ushering in a new era for Baltimore\u2019s economy as we move to a brighter future.

Thiru believes everyone is entitled to equitable resources and health care, especially in times of incredible need and uncertainty. Here's his five-point plan to adress racial disparities in COVID-19 testing and treatment.\n\nIncrease Testing & Drop Referral Requirement for at-risk Populations\nRight now, you must have a doctor's referral to be tested for COVID-19. Access to doctors is not universal. To protect at-risk populations, the doctor referral requirement should be lifted for anyone over the age of 50 living in the hardest hit neighborhoods, like 21215.\nHouse Essential Workers in Hotel Rooms for Self-Isolation\nEssential workers who are unable to isolate themselves at home should be offered free, alternative housing at hotels and motels for a 14-21 day period. Priority should be given to residents living in zip codes deemed to be COVID-19 hotspots.\nPartner with Community Leadership and Prominent Health Care Institutions\nBaltimore is home to world-class medical research facilities and hospitals. To ensure that communities that need increased testing receive the resources and treatment they need, City Hall should join our medical institutions in strategic partnerships with non-profit organizations, faith communities, and volunteers already well-established and connected on the ground.\nHalt Non-Essential Demolition and Construction in COVID-19 Hotspots\nFollowing the lead of New York and Boston, Thiru is calling for the suspension of all non- essential construction and demolition projects. Exceptions should be approved through the submission of an Essential Construction request.\nEstablish Modern Healthcare Infrastructure in Disconnected Communities\nThiru will partner with philanthropic organizations to provide internet and computer access to public housing units. The pandemic has revealed the importance of telemedicine infrastructure that allows patients to immediately and conveniently communicate with care providers.\nClose the Medicaid and Private Health Insurance Gap\nLack of insurance forces individuals to make impossible decisions between financial security and health care.

This will currently take months to ramp up.\n\nTo ensure communities receive resources and treatment,  our  medical institutions and City Hall must strategically partner with non-profit organizations, faith centers, and volunteers already well-established and connected on the ground. Particularly for low income individuals without access to private transit, some may only receive treatment at the most severe stages of their infection.\n\nDeveloped partnerships will also facilitate distribution  of  accurate information and COVID-19 tests through pop-up centers, adequately staffed for screenings, in transit deserts and hotspots. If we are unable to safely transport potential vectors to testing locations, we must directly bring the resources to hotspot locations.\n\nHealth care disparities will not vanish when the current pandemic abates. To restructure how Baltimore treats health needs, Thiru proposes:\nProviding Access to Telemedicine Infrastructure\n\nThiru has pledged to guarantee free, universal access to  high-speed wifi across the city. We know families need access now, and the digital divide leaves disinvested neighborhoods at a further disadvantage -- this was true prior to this crisis, emboldened during COVID-19, and, if we do not act now, will remain a reality for years to come. City Hall will partner with philanthropic organizations to provide internet and computer access to all public housing units. The current pandemic has revealed the importance of telemedicine infrastructure that allows patients to conveniently communicate with care providers. Telemedicine eradicates transit barriers to visiting a professional and enables real-time assessment of health issues, in turn enabling quick action to treat serious concerns. Investing in digital infrastructure will also create overarching benefits to public health by allowing children to remain engaged with their education, granting access to information and news updates, and eliminating barriers to job and assistance program applications.\nLaunching Health Intervention Program in Collaboration with Faith Communities\n\nAddressing entrenched health care disparities requires collaboration  between the public sector and community stakeholders. The Mecklenberg Health Department demonstrated this expertly with their Village HeartBEAT program, which facilitates fun, healthy competition amongst faith based congregations to improve health metrics. In addition to competition on health indicators such as weight, exercise, tobacco use, and dietary choices, the program trains community awareness ambassadors and connects members to health services. Establishing a network in Baltimore that both encourages daily changes to improve health and identifies need for additional information and services would benefit people who have historically faced insurmountable barriers to health care.\n\nExpanding Medicaid Coverage for the Uninsured\n\nTesting and treatment for COVID-19 may cost up to  $73,000  out-of-pocket for individuals without health insurance. According to the 2020 American Census, approximately 6.4% of Baltimore City residents under the age of 65 do not have medical insurance coverage. A global pandemic only exacerbates the existing health care inequities in our communities and victimizes those with pre-existing conditions, which occur at higher rates in minority populations. City leadership should embrace this opportunity to restructure our insufficient insurance coverage in Baltimore City by providing year long, city-backed medical grants to all uninsured adults that do not qualify for Medicaid coverage due to income limits. The Affordable Care Act provides subsidized health insurance for individuals from 100-400% of the Federal Poverty Line. These grants would provide the balance of the health insurance cost under the Affordable Care Act for those who are not covered by Medicaid. These grants can be renewed for the duration of the crisis, and/or until the recipient obtains employee-sponsored coverage or can independently afford insurance coverage.", "start_char_idx": 121468, "end_char_idx": 126589, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e71f9dae-e570-4990-8d8b-5e6c43b48b8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e71f9dae-e570-4990-8d8b-5e6c43b48b8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a025f5a5-66c0-4dc5-a92e-6870c901414b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "49aa5b06284528476ed132713db23a26ed70a5f157fdb5efa8e76291b5b0dd31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4779078-2bd0-482a-b3fa-ae84538f4998", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9528ad0e41a1f30e3f7f7ef0e78503e0e4005d1859f8bd3ffe18afc77354e3b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Baltimore will ban flavored tobacco products including e-cigarettes\nAs the FDA and CDC have cautioned, flavored vaping and tobacco products, like cigarillos and menthol cigarettes, present a grave health risk, particularly to children. It is no accident the use of e-cigarettes and vapes among young people has exploded, as 7 out of 10 teens are exposed to e-cigarette ads. Major e-cigarette makers are pushing colorful tobacco products, using mobile platforms like YouTube and Twitter, and promoting teen-friendly flavors. Already, 10% of high school students use e-cigarettes\u2014and more than\n60 toxins have been identified in liquid flavored products. Baltimore should follow cities from San Francisco to Chicago to Minneapolis, which have prohibited flavored products to protect their citizens and children.\nEnact complete prohibition of e-cigarettes in indoor public spaces\nThe CDC has reported that e-cigarettes not only contain nicotine, but also have lead, nickel, tin, volatile organic compounds, and diacetyl, a chemical linked to a serious lung disease. Secondary aerosol inhalation increases the risks of asthma in young children, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory symptoms and infections. Baltimore should build on its partial indoor prohibition, close the loopholes, and forbid smoking of e-cigarettes in all places cigarette smoke is banned, including bars and restaurants.\n\nInitiate city lawsuit against e-cigarette manufacturer JUUL\nNew York City and DC recently filed major lawsuits against JUUL for illegally targeting youth and intentionally misleading consumers about the consequences of its products. According to the CDC, a single JUUL or e-liquid pod contains the same amount of nicotine as roughly 20 packs of cigarettes. Just as we sued drug companies for fueling the opioid crisis, Baltimore should join the movement of cities suing this industry for creating the latest youth health crisis.\nImpose tax on e-cigarettes to fund children\u2019s health screenings at city elementary schools\nLike neighboring locales, Baltimore should impose a 50% wholesale tax on vaping products (between Montgomery County\u2019s 30% and DC\u2019s 96%), plus an additional $0.10/mL tax on e-liquids containing nicotine. The tax proceeds would pay for comprehensive health screenings of city elementary school children, as well as youth prevention efforts and treatment for those addicted.\n\nKeep tobacco money out, refuse campaign donations from industry and lobbyists\nOur campaign pledges to refuse political donations from tobacco and e-cigarette companies, as well as from their executives and lobbyists. The tobacco industry has made significant contributions to Baltimore leaders in order to block regulations that would protect our children from their harmful products. Citizens deserve to know that their health and safety comes first, not campaign finances and industry profits.\n\n\u201cI want Baltimore to become the most inviting and hospitable city in the country for the LGBTQ+ community.

Thiru stands as a proud ally to the LGBTQ community and will work with local leaders to promote policies that account for the reality that discrimination manifests itself differently depending upon race, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\nThiru\u2019s policy framework will focus on a range of  issues important to Baltimore\u2019s LGBTQ community\nand aim to break remaining barriers to full equality, including:\nPromote LGBTQ-owned small businesses, entrepreneurs, and city districts\nEnable services to account for challenges facing LGBTQ youth in Baltimore\nPrioritize inclusive workplace policies and trainings for all city employees\nAppoint an official LGBTQ Liaison within the Mayor\u2019s Executive Office\nAddress the needs of at-risk LGBTQ populations including veterans and seniors\nProtect transgender citizens from crime and discriminatory enforcement\nImprove and expand health services for members of the LGBTQ community\nBroaden LGBTQ Commission\u2019s responsibilities to include training and privacy-sensitive data collection for evidence-based policy making\nPromote LGBTQ-owned small businesses, entrepreneurs, and city districts\nBaltimore must invite small businesses and create business  alliances across the board. That said, it can take steps to specifically assist and accommodate local LGBTQ-owned businesses as well. Thiru will incorporate LGBTQ-owned businesses into the incentive programs that function through the Office of Minority and Women-Owned Business Development, in order to rightfully acknowledge their role in providing services to the citizens of Baltimore and in creating a more inclusive, diverse space for community. Building on residential and commercial districts that serve and celebrate LGBTQ culture, Thiru will also prioritize city and private investment in welcoming, inclusive neighborhoods.\n\nEnable services to account for challenges facing LGBTQ youth in Baltimore\nProtecting LGBTQ Identities in Schools\nIn April of 2019, the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners  passed Policy JBB, which ensures that transgender students have access to the restrooms of their preference and are referred to by the right gender/pronouns in class and on official documents and records. To make Baltimore\u2019s public schools even more inclusive, Thiru will establish LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum and support LGBTQ youth anti-harassment campaigns.\nCatering Homeless Shelters to LGBTQ Youth\nAccording to a recent study, roughly 40% of the homeless  youth population in the United States identify as LGBTQ. Thiru will employ the Mayor\u2019s Office of Human Services to equip Baltimore\u2019s pre-existing homeless shelters, along with transitional and supportive housing, with the resources to best serve LGBTQ youth, such as increased counseling staff, tailored job training, and access to health services.\nFounding a LGBTQ drop-in center\nThe Department of Health and Human Services shows that  LGBTQ individuals are far more likely to experience clinical depression and are roughly three times more likely to complete suicide. For these reasons, New York City has just pledged 4.8 million dollars to opening a new 24 hour drop in center for LGBTQ youth. Baltimore should follow the example of other cities and create its own drop-in center. The center would unite resources and actors, like schools and community organizations, around our LGBTQ youth.\nPrioritize inclusive workplace policies and trainings for all city employees\nDiscrimination in the workplace is an unfortunate reality for many in the LGBTQ community. Baltimore City Agencies must take proactive steps to combat prejudice against their employees. In an effort to increase accountability and establish a welcoming, respectful environment for LGBTQ employees, Thiru will implement mandatory and recurring inclusivity training for city employees, beginning with new hires. The city\u2019s existing LGBTQ Commission will head training efforts. In addition, Thiru will require there to be at least one gender-neutral bathroom in all city-owned buildings and adjust city government forms to include gender neutral language and non-binary identities.\nAppoint an official LGBTQ Liaison within the Mayor\u2019s Executive Office:\nTo increase the awareness of LGBTQ issues within the  mayor\u2019s executive office, Thiru will establish an official LGBTQ Liaison.

The LGBTQ Liaison will convene with community members, local organizations, and relevant city entities to learn about the issues that Baltimore\u2019s LGBTQ people face every day. The liaison will review city policies and services, communicate to government leaders when proposals fail to meet standards for LGBTQ equality, and serve as a resource for constituents who want to bring LGBTQ-related issues to city government but hesitate in fear of dismissal or misunderstanding. The appointed individuals would collaborate alongside the city\u2019s existing LGBTQ Commission, its selected Chairperson, as well as the Liaison Officer within the Baltimore City Police Department.\n\nAddress the needs of at-risk LGBTQ populations including veterans and seniors\nVeterans who identify as LGBTQ face increased health  risks and unique challenges in health care. Thiru will lead Baltimore in conjunction with the Veterans\u2019 Commission to collect data on LGBTQ veterans and provide them with the appropriate health benefits and services. He will also employ legal experts to aid veterans who were wrongfully subject to discrimination during service or the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy upon discharge.\nThiru will also strive to aid Baltimore\u2019s LGBTQ population, who are more prone to health issues and suffer from rising housing costs. He will prompt the LGBTQ Commission and LGBTQ Liaison in the Executive Office to advocate on behalf of the senior LGBTQ population, push for affordable housing options, and inform senior-care facility managers, employees, and residents of relevant anti-discrimination laws.\nProtect transgender citizens from crime and discriminatory enforcement\nThe nationwide surge in violent hate crimes against the  transgender community is both heartbreaking and unacceptable. Baltimore has seen multiple incidents of transphobic related violence. Thiru will work with the LGBTQ Commission Chairperson, the LGBTQ Liaison to the Executive Office, and LGBTQ Liaison Officer to bolster relationships between law enforcement and the transgender community. Further measures include 1) requiring the LGBTQ Officer to submit statistics and reports on LBGTQ-related crimes to the Mayor\u2019s Office, 2) monitoring the Police Department\u2019s fulfillment of and training related to Policy 720 (2018 draft here) and 3) incorporating recruitment of LGBTQ individuals into Baltimore\u2019s police force within crime policy proposals and halting discriminatory practices such as unnecessary trespass and loitering arrests.\nImprove and expand health services for members of the LGBTQ community\nMental Health\nLGBTQ individuals, especially youth, are more  than  twice as likely to suffer from a mental health condition compared to non-LGBTQ identifying individuals.

To some, they are an unfortunate marker of a city led by complicit politicians and failing schools that do not provide people, youth especially, with meaningful job opportunities and career advancement pathways. For others, they represent a menacing presence that deters them from bringing their families downtown. At a different time in Baltimore\u2019s history, these squeegee workers would not pose such a challenge to residents and elected officials. However, with record violence, they are an ever-present reminder that Baltimore\u2019s leaders are failing to connect the dots and support the individuals who may need it most.\n\nWe know that interactions between drivers and squeegee boys  can turn aggressive. In January 2020, we saw the heart-wrenching video of a man senselessly beaten by squeegee boys on the corner of President and Lombard. Not only do commuters feel threatened, but squeegee boys also put themselves into danger darting in between busy traffic. In October of 2018, a ten-year-old squeegee boy was injured after being struck by a car; in 1986, a fourteen-year-old squeegee boy was fatally hit by a vehicle. City Hall has yet to move the needle in a way that instills confidence that we can avoid another tragedy \u2014 we don\u2019t need another incident to learn from our past.\n\nSqueegeeing emerges from the complex problems that have  plagued Baltimore for generations: a lack of economic opportunity, unaccountability in our broken schools, a sweeping opioid epidemic, and rampant crime that disproportionately affects black and brown communities. Getting individuals off the streets and into well- paying jobs, as well as connecting them to the resources they need, will require a comprehensive approach.\n\nIdentify What Drives Individuals to Squeegeeing\n\nSqueegee boys are not one monolithic group. These individuals  have unique motivations and needs that prompt their decision to turn to squeegeeing. Thiru and his team see three distinct categories of individuals and realize each will require a personalized engagement strategy:\n\nThose who squeegee to provide for themselves and their families\n\nThose who squeegee and are themselves struggling with addiction or mental illness or come from backgrounds impacted by substance abuse\n\nThose who will attempt to continue squeegeeing regardless of diversion attempts\n\nBaltimore\u2019s existing programming and services are disjointed  and do not sufficiently provide the wraparound care that will lead to sustainable outcomes. To best engage with squeegee workers, we need to personally meet them where they are. Squeegeeing is limited to the few corners with the highest traffic volume. Our team went to the street corners, collected anecdotal evidence, and spoke with these young people, realizing that squeegeeing primarily occurs on fourteen corners:\n\nMap of Top Squeegee Locations as identified by the Thiru for Baltimore Team", "start_char_idx": 145582, "end_char_idx": 148998, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c1fa2e3-dd2e-4dc3-a60a-5f89ce22af69": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c1fa2e3-dd2e-4dc3-a60a-5f89ce22af69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad6f9ec2-bdb9-45bb-b000-7e7e08809a6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "da9146fca5c2c0f4d2a2902583656700f21048c866448e1a1c458a0fb0d014c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b61a4923-0914-42f4-b0bd-7cfa95285b52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9998fbc4834139148008f77f9b1ed628c5f41b5656c08a4d11e8282e72944f56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As mayor, Vignarajah pledges to:\n\nEnsure squeegee boys are aptly connected to pathways to advance their education or gain secure employment with advancement opportunities\n\nRecognize squeegee boys with addiction, mental illness and/or homelessness limitations that require health, addiction, housing, or job placement services and promptly facilitate access to those programs\n\nIn unique cases, where individuals will continue to turn to squeegeeing regardless of alternative options, take the tools of their trade to raise the cost of doing business\n\nCreate Alternative Work Programs that Compete with the Benefits of Squeegeeing\n\nFacilitate Job Interviews Between Squeegee Boys and Local Businesses\nCity leaders cannot pretend that creating a stable nine-to-five  job that pays $15 an hour, before taxes, can ever compete with the perks of being a squeegee boy. We must acknowledge that they can in some instances make\n$30 to $50 an hour, can come and go as they please, and  report to no one but themselves. Nevertheless, we must present an alternative employment opportunity that is attractive to these young people.\n\nThiru has already started partnering with local businesses  to provide squeegee boys with secure employment and in turn, advancement opportunities. Thiru will hire liaisons to assist squeegee boys interested in pursuing a stable, permanent career and connect them with local businesses that are willing to offer employment. While meaningful employment may present new challenges to these individuals, it can teach valuable skills, such as how to build a schedule, how to remain accountable to a team, how to build a relationship with a supervisor, and how to follow codes of conduct. The greatest opportunity provided by employment in local businesses is upward mobility. These opportunities will open an avenue for progression otherwise difficult to obtain for many of these young men, and certainly not available on a street corner.\n\nWe have refused to wait for city politicians to take action,  or even for the election, to implement a program that can provide immense benefits for our economy and these young men. Squeegee boys and local businesses interested in participating should email opportunity@thiru2020.com.\n\nStation Unarmed, Site-Specific, Deputized Community Liaisons at the Busiest Corners\n\nBring Resources to Street Corners\nDeputized community liaisons will positively interact with  squeegee boys in their designated zone, building relationships and trust. Liaisons will not take away resources from our struggling police force -- instead, these liaisons will receive specific training on de-escalation techniques, and curate a specific policy for positive and appropriate engagement with squeegee boys.\n\nPart of this positive engagement will include identifying school-aged  individuals, in partnership with the relevant schools and after-school employment or programming, where applicable, who should be required to return to their education. Each deputized liaison will receive access to point contact information for all middle and high schools in Baltimore City. The City can encourage and support heightened collaboration between the liaisons and educators/administrators to redirect these young squeegee boys back to the classroom, while making sure their needs are met and they have the guidance, resources, and support to thrive.\n\nThese deputized community liaisons would also be trained  on identifying vulnerable individuals in need of social services and City programs. They will receive training on recognizing who is suffering from food insecurity, addiction and mental illness, or housing troubles, so as to connect those individuals to appropriate experts and resources. This will take the form of Seattle\u2019s Law Enforcement Diversion Programs (LEAD) which provides a credible alternative to booking individuals with behavioral health needs for low-level offenses. Instead of creating criminal entanglements, LEAD diverts these individuals to community-based interventions including housing, addiction, mental illness and health services.\n\nRaise the Cost of Doing Business\nBaltimore\u2019s squeegee boys are making calculations on  how to make ends meet. Some will not be receptive to alternative job opportunities because of the lucrative cash flow squeegeeing provides. That being said, we need to change the calculation by not only introducing consistent and favorable options for skill development and upward mobility, but also by increasing the cost of doing business in the streets by confiscating the tools of their trade.

The illegal trade contributes to record violence, and the medical trade is not taxed.

The illegal trade contributes to record violence while depriving taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars. The illegal street market operates unimpeded as police and prosecutors publicly squabble about whether to enforce current laws, even as street marijuana is increasingly laced with fentanyl and K-2. Medical cannabis is booming but cannot be taxed and has virtually no licensed distributors of color.\nBottom line: a billion dollars is spent on cannabis products  each year, which largely ends up in the monopoly hands of untaxed licenses and violent gangs and drug organizations.\nThis is the worst of all worlds. Violence is unabated; avoidable  overdoses persist; and drug proceeds remain locked in a violent black market. Moving the cannabis trade into a well-regulated, transparent market and out of the shadows will (1) reduce gun violence driven by competing gangs, (2) decrease overdose deaths from laced marijuana, (3) reduce opioid addiction and overdoses; (4) mitigate the racial wealth gap, and (5) provide vital revenue to fund universal pre-K, finance repairs and upgrades at K-12 school facilities, guarantee free college in Maryland for public school graduates, and grow HBCU endowments. Baltimore City cannot afford to wait for indecisive lawmakers in Annapolis to take action while the City suffers from the failed war on drugs.\nJust as Colorado and other states have issued permits  and taxed the sale of cannabis, even though it remains illegal under federal law, so too should Baltimore City issue sales permits and tax cannabis. The same people who think Baltimore City has to wait for Maryland law to change thought Colorado had to wait for federal law to change. It\u2019s time for Baltimore to lead, not follow.\nIssue Permits to Baltimore Businesses to Aid Communities of Color\nWhen it comes to marijuana, the war on drugs has been a colossal failure. For decades, communities of color have disproportionately shouldered the costs of Baltimore\u2019s enforcement policies. The communities who were most devastated by the failed policies of the 1980s ought to be the first to benefit from this emerging market.\n\n\tPermits will be preferentially issued to enterprises owned, operated, and controlled by historically disadvantaged business owners of color.\nPermits will be issued to distributors owned, operated, and controlled by local businesses.\n\tPermits will be preferentially issued to enterprises  who commit to hire employees with non- violent criminal records who are seeking legitimate employment opportunities.\nRequire Tax Proceeds be Spent Strictly on Public Education Programs\nThe emerging cannabis market would produce $250  million in annual revenue for Baltimore City. Maryland and neighboring states will inevitably legalize marijuana, but there is a first-mover advantage in this industry that the City should seize. In the past, residents have been promised funds for education from controversial ventures like casinos only to see money diluted or redirected to other priorities. This won\u2019t happen again.\nAll cannabis tax proceeds will be strictly dedicated to key education programs, starting with\n(1) universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old child,  (2) repairs and improvements at K-12 facilities, (3) debt-free 4-year college, community college, or trade school for Baltimore public high school graduates, and (4) funding to grow the endowments of HBCUs.", "start_char_idx": 154215, "end_char_idx": 159090, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62f5be11-8e7e-4329-b627-35ffe9510bd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "62f5be11-8e7e-4329-b627-35ffe9510bd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a0abc93-76ea-49b6-8e5c-9bc3639feaa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "b861c6c0fd3ed7e66a2818810fe11c9852a5843b82eb38b037dcbe787128f716", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b61a4923-0914-42f4-b0bd-7cfa95285b52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "681a70310e06cd8e633a04e866c96e6be0dc109d92c4d8dc3aba4b721d36ee64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "12c8ac0f-ca83-44cf-812b-f04b29b40688", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a2f5eed13911c70eb43d627685a21657e2e552a7f7d50982a79ac387a066818", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Require Tax Proceeds be Spent Strictly on Public Education Programs\nThe emerging cannabis market would produce $250  million in annual revenue for Baltimore City.

The process and decision-making will be fully public and transparent so there are no doubts who made the decision and why.\n\tThe City will create a city-operated credit union  that holds the proceeds of cannabis sales, collects taxes and distributes them immediately to vital education programs, and eventually makes its reserve funds available for low-interest student and small business loans.\n\tThe City will create a safety board that will ensure  that recreational cannabis is safe and free of dangerous additives like fentanyl and will create and communicate clear regulations about when, where, and how the product can be sold and used.\nIn theory, in states like Colorado, prosecutors could  bring charges under federal drug laws anytime. In practice, they never have. The premise of the proposed approach is that prosecutors in Baltimore have better things to do with their time than to go after permitted, minority-owned cannabis dispensaries based in Baltimore who hire residents desperately trying to obtain legitimate employment to turn their lives around. Issuing city permits and collecting taxes would no more make the sales legal under state law than issuing state licenses makes the sales legal under federal law. But, with ingenuity and leadership, we can still bring the marijuana trade out of the dangerous shadows\u2014where gangs kill over turf\u2014and create a safer market that redresses racial inequities and generates massive tax revenue at a time when Baltimore desperately needs it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Baltimore is to become the city it\u2019s destined to be, the backbone of its economy must be small businesses.

But building an economy around art, film, and music will not happen on its own. City Hall must play a central role to ignite this industry.\nTHIRU'S PLAN TO REVITALIZE THE ARTS IN BALTIMORE\n\nExpand and support the creation of additional arts and entertainment districts in addition to Station North, Highlandtown, and Bromo Tower\n\nExtend tax-free income benefits in art districts to cover more artists, including, for example, musicians, spoken-word performers, and filmmakers\n\nCreate an \"artists in residence\" program. Participating artists and musicians would receive healthcare and a stipend in exchange for committing to teach their art in public schools and promote art in Baltimore's communities\nLead a capital campaign to raise funds from private donors in order to reinforce the shaky financial foundation of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra\n\nRe-establish incentives to encourage television producers and filmmakers to set their works in the city\nLaunch a mural initiative that matches local artists, potential donors, and community hosts to collaboratively beautify Baltimore", "start_char_idx": 158232, "end_char_idx": 163397, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12c8ac0f-ca83-44cf-812b-f04b29b40688": {"__data__": {"id_": "12c8ac0f-ca83-44cf-812b-f04b29b40688", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Press Releases (Combined through 3.15.24).txt", "file_name": "Press Releases (Combined through 3.15.24).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14970, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "525a4603-6287-43ae-8633-8db63e03128b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Press Releases (Combined through 3.15.24).txt", "file_name": "Press Releases (Combined through 3.15.24).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14970, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "59434573522925b0af0318995e3dc7d83aa967283bc9fb8be7b47029a871bb6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62f5be11-8e7e-4329-b627-35ffe9510bd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_name": "New Blueprint for Baltimore.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 164037, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "4270c56413e4609b36eecdf565db80c0bf05b01ec64532b86c92aa0395b4753b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6fa6ade4-59c9-414c-829d-f77a464405ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec6aca2c6f5faec681c74e4f1f90352792a5f53ca4847deabc3ff81cf18a99d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PRESS RELEASE \nVignarajah Announces Bid for Mayor of Baltimore \nBALTIMORE.

She will ask why the rules are being changed every few weeks, why her store has been singled out, and how the incompetence and unresponsiveness of City Hall is destroying small businesses, not just in Fells Point but across Baltimore.  \nThe press conference will take place at the Abbey Burger location in Fells Point (811 S.

February 6, 2024. \nYet another city politician convicted of a crime of greed is a dark day for Baltimore and no cause for celebration. Truth is, Marilyn Mosby follows in an embarrassing tradition set by former Mayors and other public officials who have operated as though they are above the law. We know Baltimore has better stories than this to tell to the world. \nLet no one forget Ms. Mosby is a mother and daughter, and even those who disagree with her, indeed even those of us who have run against her, should find no joy in her fall. Justice has been done. May she and her children now have the same respect and privacy we would seek as they process and prepare for what comes next and as they find comfort in the promise of redemption and grace. \n#  #  # \n\nPRESS RELEASE \nVignarajah Formally Files to Enter Race for Mayor \nBALTIMORE.

Fayette Street, Baltimore, MD 21218.

Squandering $641 million is the biggest, most unforgivable mistake of an administration that has become synonymous with incompetence.\u201d \nBALTIMORE. February 22, 2024. \nToday, at 12 PM, at 111 S. Calvert Street (19th Floor), Democratic mayoral candidate and former Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah will condemn the Mayor\u2019s total mismanagement of $641 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds\u2014that includes both the lack of timely and transparent spending as the City nears a critical federal deadline that, if missed, will cost Baltimore the remainder of the funds and the use of taxpayer dollars as a political slush fund to repay donors and developers and curry favor with special interests.  \nThe public deserves to know more about this major expenditure, and the campaign is prepared to send in advance its presentation slides to all outlets that expect to attend the press conference or report on the issue. Please make that request directly to press@votethiru.com.  \nConcerned the public is oblivious to how hundreds of millions in federal funds are being spent, Vignarajah will lead a presentation that outlines (a) where the money is headed and how much still has to be spent; (b) the list of nonprofits that were selected (who knows how?) to receive funds; (c) examples of the Mayor repaying political favors and campaign donations; and (d) illustrations of what other cities did with their federal allotment.\n\u201cThe Mayor has frittered away a once-in-a-century opportunity, padding agency budgets, repaying favors to donors and developers, and feeding pet projects and special interests,\u201d said Vignarajah. \u201cSquandering $641 million is this Mayor\u2019s biggest, most unforgivable mistake.\u201d Here are a couple examples that will be discussed: \nMayor Scott gave $5 million to Seawall Development (Lexington Market) whose owners donated thousands in campaign contributions to the Mayor.\nMayor Scott gave $2 million to SEIU whose PAC has donated thousands to his campaigns.\nThis is the same Mayor who gave $2.2 million to the deputy mayor\u2019s husband, who donated to his reelection campaign and whose downtown venue hosted the Mayor\u2019s reelection fundraiser.  \nPerhaps the only thing that may be worse is not spending the money at all. Baltimore is at risk of that, since less than half the funds\u2014some $254 million\u2014have been formally committed, which means the City has only until December to obligate hundreds of millions more in federal funds.  \nAt the press conference, Vignarajah will make three demands of the Mayor: \nLaunch an independent forensic audit right now of how the funds are being spent.\nStop obligating funds in May 2024 in the event the Mayor loses the Democratic primary and allow the winner of the Democratic primary to convene a public commission to decide on how the remainder of the funds should be obligated, which could take place during a special session of the Board of Estimates in December after the next Mayor takes office and before the December 31 deadline.\nExplain publicly how allocations were made and by whom with a specific focus on how certain nonprofits and not others were chosen and why Lexington Market got $5 million.\nVignarajah will also make two pledges himself: \nAppoint a Special Counsel in first 30 days to investigate diversion and mismanagement of funds, referring misconduct for prosecution, reclaiming misspent or unspent funds for better use, and issuing a public report within 90 days.\nForbid campaign donors from applying for city procurement contracts except with respect to projects subject to blind competitive bidding.\n### \n\nVignarajah Unveils Strategy to Address Housing Crisis \nBALTIMORE.

March 12, 2024. \nToday, at 11 AM, at 1052 W.

The most affluent neighborhoods are becoming more and more dense, and the most disinvested communities are becoming more and more dangerous,\u201d said Vignarajah. \u201cThere is no question we need to commit resources, but we also need innovation, accountability, and a sense of urgency. None of that is happening right now.\u201d  \nVignarajah will note that in 2015, there were 14,000 vacant lots and 16,000 vacant houses; today, there are 13,000 vacant houses and 20,000 vacant lots \u2014 and the City\u2019s politicians call this progress. \nThe cornerstones of Vignarajah\u2019s strategy include: \nEnding tax sales of owner-occupied properties for good.\nRestarting $1 homes program with low-interest loans and city co-investment.\nRaising taxes on blighted and abandoned properties.\nUsing city authority to seize and sell property that threatens to public safety.\nSupporting developments aimed at bringing seniors back to Baltimore.\nAlso present at the press conference will be Tony Smothers whose father purchased their rowhome through the $1 houses program and who almost lost his family\u2019s resident because of a tax sale.  \n#  #  #\n\nPRESS RELEASE \nVIGNARAJAH MAKES FIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PLEDGES \nMayoral candidate highlights commitment by leaping into freezing harbor waters;  promises to do it again if pledges are not honored within 60 days of becoming Mayor \nBALTIMORE. March 15, 2024. \nToday, at 11:30 AM, at the water\u2019s edge in Fells Point between Pitango and the Pendry, Democratic mayoral candidate and former Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah will unveil his environmental policy including five major pledges on what he will do in his first 60 days as Mayor.  \nTo show his commitment to these pledges, at the end of the press conference, Vignarajah will take a polar plunge into the Inner Harbor, promising to do it again on the last day of February 2025, if he does not make good on all five pledges in his first 60 days as Mayor.  \nVignarajah\u2019s environmental plan includes strategies to expand the tree canopy, establish twice weekly trash pickup, crack down on illegal dumping, combat lead exposure, and achieve climate resilience.  Among these plans are five pledges of what Thiru will do in his first 60 days: \nIntroduce legislation that will forbid natural gas and fossil fuels in new buildings by July 2026 (with certain commercial exceptions, e.g., factories, restaurants)\nProvide notice of intent to terminate contract with Wheelabrator on the grounds that the contract violated competitive bidding rules and breaches the Baltimore Clean Air Act\nComply with the EPA\u2019s order (May 2023) to make $2M in cleanup assistance funds available for all sewage backups that originate in the sewer mainline\nLaunch two new free bus routes, one along Park Heights Ave-North Ave-Harford Rd and a second across Edmondson Ave-Franklin St-Orleans St-Pulaski Hwy\nSign an executive order that forbids construction of private residential buildings in or near the Inner Harbor promenade or any other city public park.\n#  #  #", "start_char_idx": 10884, "end_char_idx": 14873, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "436df290-aa71-4580-81a6-977aa9660b62": {"__data__": {"id_": "436df290-aa71-4580-81a6-977aa9660b62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bea67b55-2863-44f8-a3d7-63af0e22abaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "e9f75c33522e0cf278f6a39a719ff9ba6acdeb9fe1dcb618a9fa9335b4ea4de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b69b01b3-f569-4571-9bf3-cb340817695e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Press Releases (Combined through 3.15.24).txt", "file_name": "Press Releases (Combined through 3.15.24).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 14970, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "757a208c984b9181a97409fd706f731782a2502335b0be9e505f25b5fd30f2bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "abf61acf-fb29-49c9-a1b5-642af8f3b3a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a553756161b90ee68a82bf8fd5b4351bc95dc87f07bd885929e65a420f4749be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sierra Club & Clean Water Action Baltimore City Candidate Questionnaire \n \n2024 Baltimore City Races \n \nThis questionnaire covers environmental issues you will likely consider as an elected leader of Baltimore City.

Bring to Baltimore instead its first mixedwaste materials recovery facility (MRF). \n \nRecruit a world-class Deputy Mayor for Climate, Energy, and Sustainability.  \n \nForbid any new natural gas hookups beginning in 2026 and provide low-interest loans to homeowners going electric to cover any shortfalls after federal and state incentives.  \n \nBlock the construction of luxury apartments on the water\u2019s edge and remove the massive electronic billboards that now dominate the downtown streetscape.  \n \nReverse presumptions so that 85% of requests for the City to pay sewage backup are approved, rather than denied. \n \nCreate east-west thoroughfares solely dedicated to free public transit including, for example, expanded Circulator routes into West Baltimore.   \n \nThese are certainly not the only pledges I would make or policies I would enact. But these commitments illustrate how I approach problems and showcase, I hope, how different a candidate I am, in form and substance, than the two former Mayors.  \n \nGood Government \n \n1. Do you commit to meeting with advocates before introducing, supporting or amending a bill on an issue that concerns them? What mechanisms will you use to provide transparency in your office? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nIn the past, some of the City\u2019s most consequential environmental decisions \u2014 from renewing the Wheelabrator contract to the de facto sale of the conduit system to investing in another century of gas infrastructure \u2014 have been made behind closed doors. That is no accident. The lack of timely input from advocates and the general public is partly why these terrible decisions were made. That will change on day one.  \n \nAs Mayor, I will adopt a fully transparent and deliberative process on both policy changes and land use decisions. If climate change and environmental justice are existential crises, then we need to restructure city government to reflect it. I will therefore create a new Deputy Mayor for Climate, Energy, and Sustainability. This gives Baltimore a chance to recruit a world-class advocate and gives that person a chance to shape, with direct supervisory power, every decision the City makes that impacts our environment, from construction standards to clean energy.  \n \nI will also reconstitute the Baltimore Commission on Sustainability to not merely oversee the implementation of the city\u2019s sustainability plan but also to weigh in on policy actions, City Council ordinances, and other actions in real-time. This group, along with the Deputy Mayor, would meet with me at least quarterly with additional real-time opportunities for concrete input as emergent issues arise. We will also ensure that all public documents, proposals, and applications are easily accessible online well before final decisions are made to provide meaningful opportunities for public input. \n \nLead Exposure \n \n2.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4712, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abf61acf-fb29-49c9-a1b5-642af8f3b3a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "abf61acf-fb29-49c9-a1b5-642af8f3b3a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bea67b55-2863-44f8-a3d7-63af0e22abaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "e9f75c33522e0cf278f6a39a719ff9ba6acdeb9fe1dcb618a9fa9335b4ea4de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "436df290-aa71-4580-81a6-977aa9660b62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "65b46ee734bf8ba28ffc832c2cf3458a1118c3d374255dd32b314a505b403d68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "22ca59ec-0ae7-4102-a5fd-7e7e89397982", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "649b6d0e94373d7459f83392736de18388badca3fa7596af8079728e34e824db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If climate change and environmental justice are existential crises, then we need to restructure city government to reflect it.

We will also ensure that all public documents, proposals, and applications are easily accessible online well before final decisions are made to provide meaningful opportunities for public input. \n \nLead Exposure \n \n2. City residents continue to suffer from high rates of lead poisoning, which leads to serious reading disabilities and behavior issues among children. Will you support council action and budgetary resources to protect our children and create a healthier, more affordable housing stock free of lead paint? Likewise, will you support council action and budgetary resources to complete the Department of Public Works\u2019s current search for lead service lines and the complete replacement of all lead service lines in Baltimore? And are you aware of lead dust from defunct toxic powerlines and will you work to push power companies to remove them? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nLike many environmental justice problems in Baltimore, the challenge with lead is not identifying the problem but rather insufficient strategic action in response. Baltimore has a complex history with lead poisoning, from Baltimore\u2019s first-in-the-nation ban of lead paint in 1951 (27 years before the federal ban) to the Kennedy Krieger Institute\u2019s unethical study of predominately low-income, Black Baltimore residents living in houses with lead in the 1990s. Baltimore has made significant improvements in the last fifteen years, reducing the number of children testing positive for lead paint by 97% from 1992 to 2016. Yet thousands of old homes still have unabated lead paint. The protocols remain far too reactionary, and houses coated in lead paint are concentrated in low-income, predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods where landlords are reluctant to invest in addressing the issue. The current policies include home visits resulting in referrals to legal and financial resources, education on the dangers of lead poisoning, and testing (which itself is plagued by unethical operators who will provide false lead certifications for a price, an issue we investigated and cracked down on when I was deputy attorney general under Attorney General Brian Frosh).  \n \nThese measures fail to address the root cause of the issue and have failed to eradicate the problem. It is unacceptable that 79 years after lead paint was banned in Baltimore, we still have hundreds of children suffering from lead poisoning every year. In 2018, Baltimore City had three times more children suffering from lead poisoning than any other county in Maryland. I will not only support Council action but will also take responsibility for ensuring we formulate a solution to this decades-old problem\u2014building upon work that I did as Maryland\u2019s Deputy Attorney General\u2014to force landlords to address lead issues. By taking immediate action, we can ensure that lead poisoning does not derail any more lives by stinting development, increasing violent actions, and developing behavioral challenges.  \n \nIn addition to eliminating lead paint, guaranteeing clean, safe drinking water must be one of the highest priorities of city government. Access to quality, reliable, and affordable water is a human right. We have hundred-year-old pipes that are likely unsafe, but we don\u2019t know because of a lack of testing. Under my administration, Baltimore will require water testing across the entire city, including all high-risk locations; replace all lead service lines (through a partnership with local hospitals, who are required to spend a portion of revenues on local health projects, the state [DWSRF], and the EPA\u2019s lead pipe replacement funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law); and provide filtration systems as a stop-gap for homes that need immediate relief until construction is completed. As Mayor, I will always work on the side of residents to ensure every household receives safe water. DPW is riddled with problems\u2014from failure to collect and transmit water bills to mismanagement of data\u2014and these revenues must be reinvested into replacing our failing infrastructure.

I\u2019ve taken on BGE to stop the expansion of natural gas infrastructure by preventing the unwanted deployment of external natural gas regulators, and I will do it again. \n \n[For the Mayor Only:] The US Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Act provides funds for lead pipe and paint removal. How will you assure that Baltimore is positioned to take full advantage of the law as it moves toward national implementation?  \n \nExplain: \n \nThe Scott Administration has been woefully negligent in its failure to pursue the nearly $30 billion available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace lead pipes ($15 billion specifically for lead pipe replacement, $12 billion for the State Revolving Fund) or apply any of the $641 million the city received from the American Rescue Plan, which could also have been used specifically for lead pipe replacement after Congress expanded the allowable usages. Maryland and Baltimore specifically have received significantly less for lead service line replacement, and I am committed to working with the congressional delegation and the Biden Administration to ensure Baltimore is no longer left behind. It is also unconscionable that Maryland was not selected as one of the lead service replacement accelerator states by the EPA. \n \nStormwater Management \n  \n3. As storms increase in severity, sewers will need to handle greater water flow. Will you encourage the Department of Public Works to prioritize repairs aimed at preventing backups into people\u2019s homes? Baltimore City DPW currently offers emergency cleanup assistance for backups into people\u2019s homes through the Sewage Onsite Support (SOS) program, but only backups caused by wet weather. EPA and MDE have ordered \nBaltimore City DPW to expand this program to all backups caused by issues in city infrastructure, but DPW is refusing to comply with the order. For the Mayoral candidates: Will you instruct DPW to comply with EPA/MDE\u2019s order and provide emergency assistance to all households facing backups originating in City infrastructure? For the Council candidates: Will you advocate and make budgetary resources available for DPW to comply with EPA/MDE\u2019s order and provide emergency assistance to all households facing backups originating in City infrastructure? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nI would direct DPW to comply with the EPA and MDE order and commence providing emergency assistance within 90 days of me becoming Mayor.  \n \nDespite some improvements over the past few years, the fact that 14 million gallons of sewage discharged into Baltimore Harbor and surrounding streams and waterways in just one day shows that we have much work to do. We will never clean up the Harbor or the Bay if millions of gallons of sewage continue to overwhelm antiquated combined overflow systems that transform our outdated stormwater system into a pollution superhighway, while also leading to unsanitary sewage backups in thousands of homes and causing fish kills in our waterways. As climate change brings more intense and cumulative precipitation, as Mayor, I intend to make Baltimore the most aggressive city in the nation when it comes to building and requiring green or natural infrastructure. Connected to my commitment to plant 130,000 trees and reclaim open space throughout the City, naturebased solutions will be the preferred means of slowing the velocity and volume of stormwater. By capturing more runoff before it hits the stormwater system, we can both rightsize the improvements to the man-made infrastructure and end the sewer backup. \n \nThe Back River Wastewater Treatment plant serves 1.3 million people in and around Baltimore by treating 180 million gallons of wastewater daily.

As Mayor, I will partner with the State to accelerate this work by taking advantage of improvements and expanded federal resources for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds that provide greater resources to low-income communities like Baltimore, while providing additional local funding to expedite the improvements needed to improve the operations of Black River, particularly during heavy rainfall. \n \nDPW is supposed to provide a $2,500 subsidy to homeowners for cleaning and repairing homes damaged by sewer backups due to the city\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. However, DPW only processed 67% of claims and denied 85% of those claims. This is unacceptable\u2014in fact, 100% of claims should be processed, and 85% of them should be approved. Homeowners should not be subject to a financial penalty because municipal water infrastructure and services, something exquisitely within the role and responsibility of the City to provide and maintain, causes destruction to their homes. I will ensure all claims are processed in a timely fashion and ensure that all legitimate claims are paid.  \n \nIt should be noted that refusing to pay for sewage backups caused by the failures and deficits of aging infrastructure is par for the course in a City that seems to believe\u2014for largely fiscal reasons\u2014that it cannot afford to do right by its residents when it comes to costs and consequents that result from Baltimore\u2019s failing infrastructure. For example, I have fought for months alongside homeowners on North Avenue whose properties were lost after a sinkhole formed after an aging 115-year storm drain collapsed. It had not been expected in years, yet the City has refused to pay and remains mired in litigation.  \n \nThat is not right. If a resident endures costs and consequences due to an infrastructure failure that is within Baltimore City\u2019s power and responsibility to prevent, the City should foot the bill, not the homeowner. That should apply to sewage backups, excessive water bills, and property destruction because of street-level sinkholes.  \n \n4. Will you prioritize increasing the use of green stormwater infrastructure (e.g. rain gardens, trees, permeable surfaces, bioswales) for addressing Baltimore's stormwater management, nuisance flooding, and community greening needs?  \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nGiven the projected rates of precipitation, sustained flooding, and extreme weather events fueled by climate change, green infrastructure can no longer be a novelty in Baltimore\u2019s resilience strategy \u2014 it must be at the core of it. Natural defenses, like restoring wetlands, reforesting, planting rain gardens, and revegetating every available acre of land, will be the primary ways in which my Administration will fulfill our responsibilities to protect communities and remove nutrients, bacteria, and other contaminants from entering our surface waters. These kinds of defenses should be integrated into every new construction project as a requirement, and they should be added to existing buildings through incentives.  \n \nBaltimore is still behind schedule in complying with the 2017 Modified Sewer Consent Decree, despite spending more than $1 billion on expensive engineered solutions. The reality is that, despite some critical investments, we still have discharge pipes that remain wide open spewing pollution, including for example along Jones Falls. The failure to prioritize these glaring system deficits reflects poorly on Baltimore\u2019s commitment to our city\u2019s physical presentation, our residents\u2019 health, and the environment. While the Headworks Project is supposed to drastically improve sewage flow with the effect of reducing backups into homes and the stream of waste into Baltimore\u2019s Harbor, that only works if we have the requisite professional operators to run the facility.

We must enforce the existing litter laws, drastically expand recycling, and ensure sufficient receptacles for litter and pet waste throughout the city. Since the introduction of Mr. Trash Wheel in May 2014, the Trash Wheel family has collected 1,356 tons of trash. This is a real, tangible solution to a problem plaguing Baltimore, and I will support the expansion of the popular Trash Wheel family within Baltimore\u2019s Harbor. I will also support efforts to place nets at stormwater outfalls to prevent trash from entering our surface waters in the first place, while working to retain passage for fish and other aquatic species. \n \n5. Stream restoration efforts in Baltimore currently employ heavy construction equipment to modify stream channels with the intent to handle stormwater runoff. These efforts involve a mix of straightening or changing a stream's natural patterns in an attempt to control the movement or pooling of the water. Such methods typically include removal of many mature trees and other biodiversity with little meaningful restoration or environmental damage mitigation despite opposition from residents, environmentalists, and scientists. (ER4054 -Western Herring Run restoration is widely opposed and will remove at least 700 mature trees.) Will you support efforts to address stormwater management through more sustainable means, and ensure that meaningful ecology restoration is a key requirement of city stream restoration projects? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nThis decision is simply insane. It shows what happens when you have a number of civil engineers, but few ecologists and conservation biologists, designing flood abatement projects. It simply makes no sense to remove trees to protect against flooding, considering the end result is worsened erosion and degraded biodiversity. Instead of straightening or altering natural stream patterns, we will prioritize natural channel design approaches that mimic the natural flow and function of streams. This can involve techniques such as meander restoration, floodplain reconnection, and the use of bioengineering methods to stabilize stream banks. We need to put \u201cnature first\u201d and ensure that there is a net conservation and biodiversity gain from all civil works projects. We will prioritize the preservation and enhancement of habitat for native flora and fauna in stream restoration projects. This may involve retaining mature trees, planting native vegetation, creating habitat structures such as log jams and riffle pools, and incorporating features that support wildlife corridors. Finally, as Mayor, I will implement robust monitoring and adaptive management practices to track the effectiveness of stream restoration efforts over time. This will involve monitoring water quality, habitat conditions, and ecological indicators to evaluate project success and make adjustments as needed. \n \n \t \nSolid Waste \n \n6. Baltimore City is responsible for managing municipal solid waste. Zero Waste is the conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of products, packaging, and materials without burning and no discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health. Will you work to enact policies to move Baltimore City closer to this goal during your term in office? What actions would you support or propose to improve recycling and reduce waste and litter on our streets and in our waterways?

The old adage of \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d is still true today, and that principle can create an entirely local and sustainable circular economy. As Mayor, I would invest public dollars in a state-ofthe-art materials recovery facility (MRF) that would help sort both trash and comingled recyclables to pull out all assets that could be reused or recycled. With the collapse of many parts of the global market for recyclables, I would focus on increasing local economic development opportunities for the reuse of separated materials. Providing these feedstocks at low or no cost to businesses could create a competitive advantage over competitors who are paying for virgin raw materials. Ideally, as these changes take hold, we could replace traditional trash collection with universal recycling to be processed at our new MRF. To make this a functional market, we would need to work with local businesses to phase out non-recyclable packaging (building upon Sierra Club\u2019s leadership convincing Annapolis to ban Styrofoam in restaurants/coffee shops).  \n \nTo reduce litter on our streets and in our waterways, I will ensure there are convenient, accessible recycling receptacles throughout the city that minimize the work required from the disposer, i.e., proper signage and open holes instead of covered access points. These receptacles would have sufficiently frequent pickups to ensure no overflow. In conjunction with the expansion of green spaces to minimize stormwater runoff, I would invest in green spaces to make the city more attractive, discouraging people from littering. This investment and the expansion of receptacles would occur in every neighborhood, with a conscious concentration of investment in neighborhoods currently lacking green space or receptacles. It is unacceptable for the cleanliness of the streets and the greenness of the neighborhood to correspond to the income level of its residents. Everyone wants clean streets, and everyone deserves them.  \n \nThe recent explosion of a youth-driven environmental movement to protect our planet for future generations has been inspiring. I would build on this existing passion by encouraging schools to participate in litter collection competitions, plastic-free events for school functions, outdoor learning experiences, and seminars on the benefits of recycling and composting. This would naturally disperse information regarding zero-waste principles across the city. \n \nI would finance these programs by saving tens of millions of dollars annually by avoiding tipping fees and payments to the incinerators, as well as identifying existing wasteful spending in city agencies through top-to-bottom audits, stringent fiscal management of agency budgets, seeking non-profit and private partnerships, and applications for grant funding from the MDE and the EPA. \n \nOrganic waste, like food scraps and yard trim, is 30-40% of the average municipal waste stream and, when left in the waste stream, creates carbon emission when burned in an incinerator and methane emissions when decomposed in a landfill. Do you agree that city-wide compost collection and the establishment of composting facilities at scale is critical to divert waste from landfill and incineration? If, so what would you do to expand compost collection and processing in the city? \n \nYes\u2014I am very excited about the idea of a citywide composting program. This will reduce carbon and methane emissions while creating jobs and creating rich soil that could sustain an unprecedented regenerative urban agriculture initiative. I will pull together the best and brightest to learn from the lessons of San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Boulder, and most recently, New York City.

This has allowed some stores to provide single-use film plastic bags that are 4 mils thick. Would you support a bill to remove the 4 mil thickness standard for film plastic bags thereby eliminating all film plastic bags? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nPlastic film continues to pollute our waterways and gum up our water treatment facilities. I would support eliminating all film plastic bags. \n  \n9. [For the Mayor only:] In your meetings with the city delegation and/or Governor Moore regarding legislative issues to be addressed by the General Assembly, will you include advocacy for the following Zero Waste priorities: \n \na. the Beverage Container Recycling Refund and Litter Reduction Program, the provisions of which have resulted in a 90% plastic bottle recycling rate in MI and Oregon vs. MD\u2019s 23% rate?  \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nWe need a bottle bill in Maryland. States with bottle bills, like Michigan, Maine, and Oregon, have several-fold higher bottle recycling rates than those without, like Maryland. I will push the State delegation and the Governor to make this a priority. \n \nb. The Reclaim Renewable Energy Act, which will eliminate trash incineration from Maryland\u2019s Renewable Standard, redirecting ratepayer money wasted to profit polluting trash incinerators like the BRESCO incinerator in Baltimore to support truly renewable energy that will help clean Baltimore\u2019s air instead? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nFour years ago, I committed to shutting down the BRESCO incinerator and remain committed to it today. I remember now-Mayor Brandon Scott making the same promise before unconscionably extending the contract for a decade. That contract is legally defective. Accordingly, I will give the international parent conglomerate a chance to convert that contract into a presumptive right to build the City a materials recovery facility, or I will break the contract, tie up the company in litigation for five years, and allow all companies to bid on the privilege. Either way, in my first term, Baltimore will shut down the incinerator permanently and replace it with a materials recovery solution fit for the next generation.   \n \nTransportation \n \n10. A successful 21st Century city needs a comprehensive public transportation system to support its economy, equity, and the climate. Cities around the country and the world are expanding rail, building Bus Rapid Transit lines, transitioning to electric buses, adding protected bike lanes and new walking trails, and placing much greater emphasis on pedestrian safety. People using public transportation in Baltimore can access only a small percent of the jobs in the metropolitan area within an hour. Do you support increased regional transit investments in Baltimore like those described above? What will you do to help make this type of comprehensive 21st Century public transportation system a priority for Baltimore?  \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nYes. Mobility is crucial to economic development and upward mobility. I plan to invest in transit expansion in a sustainable, environmentally conscious manner. Currently, our eastto-west avenues are dedicated to motor traffic. In my first 100 days as Mayor, I intend to repurpose some of the avenues exclusively for public and green transportation. We will provide free east-to-west buses, bike lanes, and pedestrian passages along these avenues. The elimination of cars from these passages would improve the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians by simply reducing the volume of traffic. The concentrated motor traffic on the remaining avenues would likely decrease Baltimoreans\u2019 desire to drive, while the free and green transit options would see a corresponding increase in popularity as the faster and cheaper option, causing a natural reduction in motor transportation and air pollution\u2014all of which will be paid for by the increase in revenues from increased employment.", "start_char_idx": 24318, "end_char_idx": 29214, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f90d096a-0808-4717-88af-8e634c90016e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f90d096a-0808-4717-88af-8e634c90016e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bea67b55-2863-44f8-a3d7-63af0e22abaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "e9f75c33522e0cf278f6a39a719ff9ba6acdeb9fe1dcb618a9fa9335b4ea4de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "608d42a7-626e-48e9-9f50-795e62497592", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "71b746ea7f8d261fc0dfff47a746e526a119e0672b39b2c7c2d413544b7055de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74b9ea67-353d-4d7b-bb90-72c1254559fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28347208f2c15837cb5a9f30e6c0c35c23dbf96bd55b0cf13d781f823e10ee5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Yes or No: Yes \n \nYes.

My vision is that we quickly demonstrate demand for East-West transit through expanded free bus lines along Edmondson Avenue and North Avenue and then add some of the crisscrossing arteries like Belair Road and Harford Road. \n \n11. The Moore Administration is currently undergoing planning efforts for the revived Red Line. Will you advocate to the Moore Administration that the Red Line be constructed as light rail rather than bus rapid transit, which will serve more riders at less annualized capital cost per trip? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nMy proposed free buses should complement light rail, not replace it. Governor Moore\u2019s inclination to replace the original commitment to light rail with bus rapid transit is shortsighted. I will do everything in my power to restart a light-rail Red Line 2.0 with the goal of completion by 2032. In the meantime, I will immediately start a free east-to-west bus system with the green avenues referenced above. \n \n12. Active transit is an important component of mobility throughout the city and of reducing emissions from the transportation sector. Will you support the development of more pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in Baltimore, and how will you ensure that the City is safe for pedestrians and bicyclists to travel throughout the City?  \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nI am fully committed to supporting the development of more pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure throughout Baltimore, and the recent debates pitting communities against one another on the topic of bike lanes is unfortunate and unnecessary. Active transit is not only essential for improving mobility and reducing emissions from the transportation sector but also for promoting public health and creating vibrant, livable communities.  \n \nGreat cities everywhere have comprehensive bike infrastructure, and that must be Baltimore\u2019s goal too. To ensure Baltimore is safe for pedestrians and bicyclists to travel, we will take a comprehensive approach that focuses on several key strategies: \n \nInvesting in Infrastructure: We will prioritize investments in pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, including the development of safe and accessible sidewalks, bike lanes, multi-use trails, and pedestrian-friendly streetscapes. This will involve working closely with city agencies, community organizations, and transportation advocates to identify key priority areas and allocate resources effectively. That will also include providing incentives in the form of grants, subsidies, or tax breaks to communities and neighbors who are bearing an unwanted or undue burden because of the addition of infrastructure.  \n \nEnhancing Safety Measures: We will implement targeted safety measures to protect pedestrians and bicyclists, such as traffic calming measures, improved street lighting, and the installation of pedestrian crossings and bike-friendly intersections. Additionally, we will explore innovative solutions such as dedicated bike signals and protected bike lanes to further enhance safety. \n \nPromoting Education and Awareness: We will launch public education campaigns to raise awareness about the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as driver awareness programs to encourage safer driving behaviors and respect for vulnerable road users. These efforts will be aimed at fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding among all road users. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Input: We will actively engage with communities and stakeholders to solicit input and feedback on pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure projects, ensuring that they reflect the needs and priorities of residents across the city. Community input will be integral to the planning, design, and implementation of active transit initiatives. \n \nData-Driven Decision Making: We will use data and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure projects and identify areas for improvement. This will involve monitoring crash data, traffic volumes, and usage patterns to inform future investments and policy decisions. \n \nBy taking a holistic approach to pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure development and prioritizing safety, accessibility, and community engagement, we can create a city where walking and biking are safe, convenient, cost-effective, and enjoyable modes of transportation for all residents. \n \nEnvironmental Justice \n \n13.", "start_char_idx": 28221, "end_char_idx": 33598, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74b9ea67-353d-4d7b-bb90-72c1254559fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "74b9ea67-353d-4d7b-bb90-72c1254559fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bea67b55-2863-44f8-a3d7-63af0e22abaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "e9f75c33522e0cf278f6a39a719ff9ba6acdeb9fe1dcb618a9fa9335b4ea4de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f90d096a-0808-4717-88af-8e634c90016e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "a27a2e53a8a9f1e6d704b22b00aa6ec7624383c70459d889a7530ef4659110ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1557b920-6568-4ecf-8b9c-fa7a11e3f327", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2f2a9bfc3226807304e5c1101679fce64a03c1b82febbea1ed526a698755c45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These efforts will be aimed at fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding among all road users. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Input: We will actively engage with communities and stakeholders to solicit input and feedback on pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure projects, ensuring that they reflect the needs and priorities of residents across the city.

Many of Baltimore\u2019s economically disadvantaged areas are subject to the hazards of environmentally harmful industries and facilities located in their communities. Air pollution from these sites impacts health and can cause asthma. According to the Baltimore City Department of Health, the city\u2019s children have an asthma rate twice the national average. What will you do to ensure that all neighborhoods receive protection when projects or developments that would introduce additional sources of pollution are proposed? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nEnvironmental racism continues to persist in Baltimore\u2014and not just from facilities sited half a century ago, but with recent siting decisions in the past two few decades. While I applaud efforts to encourage an \u201cequity screen\u201d of various budget decisions, the reality continues that polluting facilities, like the incinerator, are disproportionately sited in communities of color. This isn\u2019t just about spending money \u2014 it\u2019s about structural racism cloaked in land use decisions. \n \nI have proposed that any industrial facility or energy generating facility require a cumulative impacts analysis similar to NEPA (before Trump\u2019s illegal rollback, which the Biden Administration is working to repromulgate) or California\u2019s Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)\u2014and a commensurate level of sustained public outreach in the communities most affected. The aggregate impacts of the siting of power plants and industrial facilities close to neighborhoods, combined with the locations of 95 and 83 bringing cars and heavyduty trucks through city neighborhoods to spew particulate matter (the recently proposed nine-microgram standard will help reduce this) and NO2, continue to be a public health disaster, even after years of efforts to reduce ozone and particulate matter. I will launch unprecedented efforts to ensure existing facilities are fulfilling their permit responsibilities (working with MDE and EPA), including increasing publicly accessible fence-line monitoring data. I will also invest heavily in the remediation of brownfield sites to reduce rates of cancer and other illnesses.  \n \nIn addition to much greater public input into land use decisions and more stringent facility standards/pollution controls, the long-term solutions involve a rapid transition to clean energy, electric vehicles/alternative transportation, reforestation, etc. \n \n14. The BRESCO trash incinerator owned by WIN Waste burns Baltimore City and Baltimore County\u2019s trash in South Baltimore, emitting significant greenhouse gasses and health-harming local air pollution. Baltimore City is currently under contract to send waste to the incinerator through 2031. In your term in office, will you support programs and initiatives to develop alternative methods of waste disposal and end trash incineration in Baltimore as soon as possible? Are there specific policies you would like to enact to develop this infrastructure and/or shut down the incinerator no later than the end of the current contract in 2031? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nThe visual of Baltimore simply cannot be a smokestack with the City\u2019s name emblazoned on it. No strategy that depends upon alone \u201cstarving the beast,\u201d as suggested in the Sustainability Plan, will ever work, because the loss of city trash will just be displaced by trash from other communities. We need an entirely new approach to shutting it down for good. The fact that this facility is not required to disclose its pollution levels through the Toxic Release Inventory is an absolute disgrace and an abuse of a massive loophole. My pledge to shut down the incinerator within my first terms depends on four strategies:  \n \nRepresent to Wheelabrator and its parent that the City is prepared to break the contract the previous Mayor had minted and proceed to litigation if the company does not voluntarily agree to having first-right-of-refusal on a city contract to build a mixedwaste materials recovery facility to replace the incinerator.", "start_char_idx": 32496, "end_char_idx": 37586, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1557b920-6568-4ecf-8b9c-fa7a11e3f327": {"__data__": {"id_": "1557b920-6568-4ecf-8b9c-fa7a11e3f327", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bea67b55-2863-44f8-a3d7-63af0e22abaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "e9f75c33522e0cf278f6a39a719ff9ba6acdeb9fe1dcb618a9fa9335b4ea4de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74b9ea67-353d-4d7b-bb90-72c1254559fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "20716c37c9c5364281e179beb304ee0e6a48cacf336856ca094aa913356436c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d742f494-f8b6-4b73-9d90-42526ebca7d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db2b868093a4851e20c6f4818c4633f02aa9ba026802754e5c998528aea8b0a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Yes or No: Yes \n \nThe visual of Baltimore simply cannot be a smokestack with the City\u2019s name emblazoned on it.

Natural gas is mostly methane gas, which is more than 80+ times potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. There is a movement across the U.S. and within Maryland counties to require new construction to be all electric. Do you support transitioning from methane gas infrastructure to electric? Towards that end, do you support a law that will require new construction and significant renovation (>50% of new structural components or an increase of 50% of floor area) to be all electric, as in, no gas connections to new construction?  \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nI am committed to 100% clean energy by 2028\u2014not just for city operations but for Baltimore as a whole. With the incredible resources and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, achieving 100% is entirely possible. We will place solar panels on rooftops, parking garages, landfills, and brownfields. We will lead the State in geothermal energy to reduce energy demand for heating and cooling. We will be a leading off-taker of offshore wind, ideally generated by component parts manufactured in Baltimore with local city labor. And we will lead the State in energy efficiency and conservation because the cleanest energy will always be the energy we do not use. Not only is it the right thing to do, it is also beneficial for Baltimore\u2019s economy, the City\u2019s fight against crime, and youth development. This effort would create thousands of well-paying careers in development, manufacturing, and deployment.  \n \n16. Electrification of heating and cooling systems and appliances promises to reduce long term costs for homeowners and reduce the incidence of asthma and other health issues as well as reducing green-house gas emissions. The US Inflation Reduction Act and the updated Maryland EmPOWER Act will offer substantial rebates to homeowners who transition to electric heating and cooling with heat pumps or mini-splits and/or electric stoves and other appliances.  \n \nHow will you work to help lower-income residents to take advantage of these rebates and financial incentives for upgrading their homes?  \n \nThe incentives from the IRA are incredible and make electrification of homes affordable for all Baltimoreans. I will engage all residential contractors and suppliers to ensure they know about the IRA\u2019s programs and incentives, while waging a massive public relations campaign in partnership with MEA to ensure that all residents can take advantage of the programs. Even with the incentives, the greatest challenge facing many residents will be access to upfront capital, so I will set aside at least $50 million for a revolving loan fund that could pay for the upfront costs while being repaid by the savings, possibly through the PACE mechanism of repaying on property tax bills. \n \nWill you require or incentivize significant renovation (>50% of new structural components or an increase of 50% of floor area) of all homes (including vacant) be retrofitted using electric heat pumps for heating, cooling, and hot water, and all electric appliances as part of their renovation? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nMoving to electric is the only responsible decision.", "start_char_idx": 36628, "end_char_idx": 41419, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d742f494-f8b6-4b73-9d90-42526ebca7d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d742f494-f8b6-4b73-9d90-42526ebca7d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bea67b55-2863-44f8-a3d7-63af0e22abaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "e9f75c33522e0cf278f6a39a719ff9ba6acdeb9fe1dcb618a9fa9335b4ea4de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1557b920-6568-4ecf-8b9c-fa7a11e3f327", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "880eb23774eb72ea51acf85329229bb8d8ef1371305ef9aff4d1017426e3f272", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0d47971-089e-484a-a759-ef85dd6b4cf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a74bb318014c8b3ebe38babb4a45d3619394018a5cf373ad8b4295126763fa70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I will engage all residential contractors and suppliers to ensure they know about the IRA\u2019s programs and incentives, while waging a massive public relations campaign in partnership with MEA to ensure that all residents can take advantage of the programs.

What is not responsible is investing billions to reinforce gas infrastructure that will last a century. This is one of the main reasons I fought so hard to stop BGE from installing new high pressure gas pipelines. Not only will I support a requirement that all new construction and significant expansions have heat pumps and electric appliances; I would also join other jurisdictions like Montgomery County that prohibit new gas connections altogether, beginning in 2026. Between IRA incentives, state inducements, and city-financed loans, there is no reason for any property not to go electric. \n \nPreserving Biodiversity: \n \n17. Approximately one billion birds are killed annually, especially during spring and fall migration, when they hit windows. Would you support legislation to have new or significantly refurbished city and large commercial buildings use energy saving bird safe windows similar to legislation passed for Maryland government buildings? \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nPerhaps after only Cape May, New Jersey, the State of Maryland boasts many of the most incredible birding spots on the Eastern Seaboard. The State sits along the Atlantic Flyway, one of the four major North American migratory flyways \u2014 and in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Because Baltimore, along with New York, Philadelphia, and DC, have the largest concentration of large buildings along the migratory path, the City must take steps to ameliorate the dangers of urban structures that often bring a sad and abrupt stop to these birds\u2019 migratory journeys.  \n \nNo great innovation is needed for Baltimore to adopt laws requiring bird-safe windows. \nSan Francisco pioneered this sort of legislation when it first adopted Standards for BirdSafe Buildings in 2011. Both New York City and Washington, DC have recently passed comparable legislation. Baltimore should follow suit.  \n \nSpecifically, I would vocally support legislation requiring buildings of a certain height, as well as all government buildings in Baltimore, to use bird-safe window glass. \n \n18. There is growing awareness of the adverse impact of light pollution on wildlife. Would you support legislation to reduce light pollution (e.g. turning off lighting on unoccupied floors of buildings, using warmer bulbs, installing downward directing lighting) for commercial and government buildings in Baltimore as other cities like Pittsburgh.   \n \nYes or No: Yes \n \nI wholeheartedly support legislation to reduce light pollution in our city. Light pollution not only disrupts the natural rhythms of wildlife but also affects human health and wellbeing. By implementing measures such as turning off lighting on unoccupied floors of buildings, using warmer bulbs, and installing downward directing lighting, we can significantly mitigate the adverse impacts of excessive artificial light. \n \nPerhaps the most striking illustration of the current administration turning a blind eye to light pollution is the City\u2019s agreement to convert downtown Baltimore into a Vegas strip by allowing massive electronic billboards for a meager $300K in annual fees. \n \nFollowing the example of cities like Pittsburgh, we will work collaboratively with stakeholders to draft legislation that promotes responsible outdoor lighting practices while ensuring that safety and security concerns are addressed. This legislation will not only protect our environment but also enhance the quality of life for all Baltimore residents.  \n \nAs Mayor, I will also reverse the decision to allow electronic billboards downtown, citing the strong opposition voiced by downtown residents and the lack of transparency and public discussion when the original decision was made.  \n \n*   *   *   *   *", "start_char_idx": 40478, "end_char_idx": 45122, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0d47971-089e-484a-a759-ef85dd6b4cf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0d47971-089e-484a-a759-ef85dd6b4cf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Sun Voter Guide 2020.txt", "file_name": "Sun Voter Guide 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 575, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f46ddcac-675b-4f7a-9c59-b4b780c85f70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/Sun Voter Guide 2020.txt", "file_name": "Sun Voter Guide 2020.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 575, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "e09222d3948f3d8d9f111c5629140792e15ed3ba455c9479b677b50d54ceb647", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d742f494-f8b6-4b73-9d90-42526ebca7d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_name": "SC & CWA Baltimore City Candidates' Questionnaire (Thiru Vignarajah).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45275, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "2fa85cecf559ce2eab1164d8aa3a826e20f8829e8a46eea15ad64ae918c48e0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae8b7bcb-60b2-4548-86a4-a3cb5bf55e83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "364fd7579b3d57df598d8eb47517065df527b709ada4138df6a2e124882a875e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Baltimore Sun is preparing its online voter guide for the upcoming election.

(145)\nViolent crime in\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0has never been worse. I spent my life as a prosecutor and public servant, and I am confident I can help turn this tragedy around. In a time of crisis like this,\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0does not need a politician or a defense attorney\u2014it needs a proven prosecutor. I am running because my unique career as a federal, city, and state prosecutor matches the demands and urgency of this moment.\nI am also running because I remain indebted to\u00a0Baltimore. This city gave my parents jobs as teachers. I am myself the product of public schools, from Edmondson Heights Elementary to Woodlawn High. After studying at Yale University and Harvard Law School\u2014and after serving as president of the Harvard Law Review and law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014I returned home to make a difference in the place that made me.\u00a0For me, this is a calling.\n\u00a0\n10) What is the most pressing issue\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0faces regarding crime and criminal justice?*\nCrime in\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0has skyrocketed because police and prosecutors no longer work together, the community\u2019s trust has been broken by the lack of progress on police reform, and criminals know there are no consequences for their crimes. There are deeper problems too, from poverty and disinvestment to segregation and broken schools. These entrenched obstacles must be overcome if we are to reduce murders from over 300 to less than 100, and that work must begin now. But, to drive murders from over 300 to\u00a0less than 200, we can start with the pressing threshold problems of getting police and prosecutors to constructively work together, convincing the community to trust police again, and to make clear to criminals that it is their turn to be afraid. On these priorities, the State\u2019s Attorney must lead the charge, not stand in the way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n11) Would you continue the current policy not to prosecute low-level, nonviolent offenses such as drug possession, open container and prostitution? Why or why not?* (149)\nI would rescind Marilyn Mosby\u2019s blanket policy that certain crimes will no longer be prosecuted.\u00a0 Her announcement\u2014with no preparation or coordination with police\u2014has created confusion amongst law enforcement, improperly usurped the legislature\u2019s prerogatives, and emboldened criminals.\nInstead, we will return to using common-sense judgment to decide which cases to pursue. For instance, only in exceptional cases would we prosecute loitering or trespass, crimes often identified as an instrument of racial profiling and discriminatory policing. To ensure that victims of addiction and trafficking get the help they need, we would expand pre-arrest diversion programs like LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion), as well as pretrial initiatives such as the District Court Reentry Project, which gives low-level offenders the opportunity to pursue apprenticeships, skills training, and vocational careers as a condition of probation. We would also institute internal guardrails like requiring a supervisor\u2019s approval before prosecuting offenses like drug possession.\n12) How will your office help reduce gun violence? (150)\nWe must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands and hold perpetrators accountable when gun violence occurs. Untested prosecutors are currently assigned to firearms cases to gain experience on the flawed view that gun possession is a victimless crime, not a precursor to violence. We will establish a specialized unit of seasoned prosecutors who work with police and federal agencies to pursue gun traffickers and build better cases for trial based upon solid evidence, not stop-and-frisk policing.

We will establish a specialized unit of seasoned prosecutors who work with police and federal agencies to pursue gun traffickers and build better cases for trial based upon solid evidence, not stop-and-frisk policing. More firearms cases should go to federal court where repeat offenders face stiffer and more certain penalties. We will also reorganize the office so prosecutors are, by district, dedicated to certain categories of gun crimes, from robberies and carjackings to shootings and killings. Finally, through skills training, job opportunities, and focused deterrence, we will invest in returning citizens at greatest risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence themselves.\n13) How would you address racial inequities in the criminal justice system?* (150)\nThe first step is to recognize that racial inequities undermine and infect every stage of the justice system, for victims and the accused. Prosecutors have the power and responsibility to ameliorate these longstanding failures. But it is hard to fix what you cannot measure. So, we will track and regularly publish race-based data for arrest and clearance rates, detention and diversion decisions, and plea bargains and trials. We will also conduct implicit bias training for police agencies and our own staff; ensure diversity in hiring and retention; expand alternatives to incarceration, diversion, and restorative justice programs; undo wrongful convictions; and develop guidelines to ensure that the race of neither the defendant nor the victim improperly affects our judgments. Finally, we will mitigate the collateral consequences of contact with the judicial system by, for example, ending cash bail and facilitating the automatic expungement of arrests that are eligible under Maryland law.\n14) How would you use your role to bring down violent crime in\u00a0Baltimore? How is this different from what's already happening and what's been tried before? Why will your idea be successful?* (150)\nSince 2015,\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0has averaged 333 murders every year\u2014that\u2019s over 2,400 people killed in total. In 2011, while I spearheaded the Major Investigations Unit, we had fewer than 200 homicides. We were making progress, and we can do it again.\nThis requires immediately mending fences with the police department, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and the Governor, and I am the best candidate to do this. We also need fresh approaches. We will start by focusing on unsolved crimes that bear the markings of repeat offenders, like daytime homicides involving high-caliber weapons, headshots, and 10+ casings at the crime scene. In addition, we will relentlessly prosecute those gangs that disproportionately drive violence, using wiretaps, Maryland\u2019s gang law, and federal RICO statutes. And we will use lower-level offenses, like burglaries, to build prosecutions of violent repeat offenders who have done far worse. \u00a0\n15) Resignations have left prosecutors with crushing caseloads. What would you do to stabilize the office, retain staff and attract talent?* (150)\nWe need a leader who can bring back seasoned prosecutors and bring in fresh talent, drawing from neighboring counties, local law firms, and the Justice Department. To improve culture, we will reorganize the office, assigning prosecutors to districts, creating citywide specialty units, and having dedicated juvenile justice prosecutors. This will not be easy, but it is not without precedent.\nAfter Robert Morgenthau lost a bid for governor, he was elected Manhattan District Attorney.

To further this goal, we will adopt a community prosecution model\u2014similar to community policing\u2014where individual prosecutors are assigned to specific neighborhoods, so citizens get to know the prosecutors who are responsible for cases in their communities. Second, we will teach prosecutors that keeping victims and witnesses safe, engaged, and informed is one of their most important responsibilities. When witnesses cooperate, we will honor the risks they take by zealously pursuing justice in those cases, by not carelessly dropping cases, and by not giving them away in improvident plea deals designed to artificially boost conviction numbers.

Prosecutors and police must also answer questions like whether the suspected presence of marijuana, which remains illegal under federal law, could constitute probable cause or be the basis of a search warrant; whether an overarching federal prosecution is appropriate when dealers sell cocaine, heroin, and marijuana; and whether emerging cryptocurrencies or more cash transactions create public risks if federally-insured banks decline financial transactions linked to an industry that still violates federal law.\n18) How will your office hold the police accountable?* (150)\nWe will conduct thorough, transparent, and impartial investigations of alleged misconduct and all use-of-force cases, while deferring to the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s new investigative prerogatives.

But police accountability cannot start only when the cameras are rolling after a tragedy strikes.

Many will be tempted to raise property taxes to fill the gaps. They should cut them instead. This isn\u2019t only sound economics\u2014it\u2019s also an antidote to a regressive taxation scheme whose costs fall unfairly on the country\u2019s poorest homeowners, many of them minority residents of struggling cities. \nThe traditional case against high property tax rates is that they deter investment, chase people out of cities, and make it harder to attract new residents. Growing empirical evidence from across the country shows that property taxes are also inequitable, saddling low-income homeowners with a lopsided share of municipal tax burdens.\nOn the surface, it isn\u2019t intuitive why property taxes are unfair. They are calculated, after all, as a fixed percentage of a home\u2019s assessed value. The problem is that houses in poor neighborhoods generally sell for less than the assessment values used to calculate their property taxes, while expensive homes in affluent communities reliably sell for more than their assessed values. Tax assessors systematically undervalue America\u2019s priciest homes and consistently overvalue the country\u2019s least expensive homes. Affluent homeowners may be paying less in taxes than they should, and poorer homeowners have been paying more than they should.\nTake Baltimore. According to data from a recent University of Chicago study, more than 75% of the city\u2019s least valuable homes sold between 2007 and 2018 yielded prices that were lower than the assessment value used for property taxes. The exact opposite is true when it comes to Baltimore\u2019s most lavish homes. During that same period those residences sold on average for more than twice the value used to compute property taxes. \nThis absurdity is amplified by Baltimore\u2019s high property tax rate, which is twice that of neighboring counties, even as the city hemorrhages people. Baltimore has fewer residents in 2020 than it had in 1920. In return for paying the highest property taxes in the state, city dwellers get a stew of the worst services and outcomes in the U.S.: Municipal ineptitude leading to uncollected water bills, potholes pockmarking every other street, alleys strewn with trash. Many of Baltimore\u2019s public school buildings lack heat or drinkable water, and the city\u2019s homicide, drug-overdose, illiteracy and lead-poisoning rates are among the highest in America.\nWhat an injustice that the residents most directly affected by this dysfunction are often the same homeowners who, because of inflated assessments, pay a higher share of the city\u2019s property taxes. Baltimore isn\u2019t alone in this regard. The same cruel irony persists in Detroit, Atlanta, St. Louis and other cities caught in the quicksand of exorbitant taxes.\nBecause of the myopia caused by the current crisis, leaders in cities like Baltimore may be unwilling to cut taxes. To reverse decades of decline and inequity, however, this is exactly what they must do. And they need to start now because U.S. cities are about to enter a fierce contest for capital as the economy emerges from pandemic-related strictures. How we work and where we live will never be the same, and unrivaled investments will accompany this transformation. Relief dollars from Washington will be dwarfed by pent-up private capital spilling into markets as American consumers begin to spend money again. This could be the biggest infusion of federal capital into the economy since the New Deal and the largest introduction of private investment ever.\nThose investments won\u2019t be distributed evenly, however, and cities will need to set themselves apart, conspicuously and fast. In the scramble to grab a share of this gold rush, there\u2019s no time to lose. Cities should pledge to cut property taxes immediately because investment decisions are being made now.\nThe economic upside of cutting property taxes is evident in the academic literature. A 1999 school-finance reform in New Hampshire resulted in property-tax cuts across the Granite State. In low-density areas, economists found an 11% to 22% jump in residential construction; in southern New Hampshire, where housing concentration was already high, tax cuts drove up home prices instead. Both results\u2014a surge in construction and higher home values\u2014materialized in Boston and San Francisco too.

It was the clearest policy demand at last month\u2019s March on Washington.\nIt also marks a Maginot line for Republicans, with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott calling the end of qualified immunity a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that is, a suggestion so toxic for his political kin that it would kill off the possibility of building consensus around other police reform proposals.\nCompromise is not the mood of America today, but it is needed here. This once obscure, now contentious doctrine, which all but precludes private lawsuits against police officers, does not have to be scrapped completely to satisfy its critics.\nInstead, Congress (or state legislatures) should withdraw qualified immunity for excessive force claims but otherwise keep it intact. Excessive force, after all, is where the immunity defense inspires the most grief and makes the least sense.\nQualified immunity, a rule many conservatives steadfastly support, was invented by judges. It is not in the Constitution; it\u2019s not rooted in colonial history or legal tradition; no legislature has ever ratified it.\nThe doctrine was first hatched by the Supreme Court in 1967. Since then, it has become an increasingly vexing obstacle for anyone suing a public official.\nBy the 1980s, a lawsuit could move forward only if the defendant violated \u201cclearly established\u201d law, the latest in a series of tripwires that extinguished most cases. From inoculating schoolteachers from lawsuits by their students to gutting cases by patients against hospital administrators, the doctrine\u2019s steady creep gobbled up more and more cases, but reached excessive force claims only in the mid-2000s.\nThat means reversing this last expansion does not void the doctrine \u2014 it merely resets the law to where it was before courts began to approve its application in police brutality cases.\nThe logic for immunity also collapses in the excessive force context. Qualified immunity was meant for situations where legal rules are unsettled or evolving, where a public official might be forgiven for not knowing the precise state of the law.\nFor example, Fourth Amendment rules can be tricky. Should police get a warrant to electronically track a car on public streets? Is the smell of marijuana enough to conduct a search in middle-ground states that have decriminalized marijuana possession but where selling weed is still illegal? These are byzantine questions debated by law professors, whose answers shift from one court opinion to the next.\nThe law of excessive force, by contrast, is not confusing or complex. Whether force is justified certainly depends on the circumstances of the situation, but that\u2019s true for lots of discretionary judgments. Doctors are not shielded from liability just because they need to make hard decisions in emergency conditions.\nThe point is, the law on the use of force is not erratic or hard to comprehend and, consequently, allegations of police brutality are the last place where qualified immunity should be available.", "start_char_idx": 3898, "end_char_idx": 8856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c3aaaa5-8eaa-4acf-b922-0b347475e6eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c3aaaa5-8eaa-4acf-b922-0b347475e6eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e93a5633-e38d-4e07-88a4-38eb0bbbe125", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "5904ec188ebc0d18da626ab39603d9a436b5bf4636858d1bf9c2f5c5b93dc322", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c497e010-dd13-4018-88b2-ffb86c39998c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "4ade5dd6214c84c8c94bab7f31d871e6d95e7c246a99bc058ef27bb516be63b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf16586d-badd-4ee3-9cd6-01f5587d02c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98890546750a82b34d7d5d70a4f1a1f2bcbcc51a9dd3d9ee5e867c19660d6bf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, Fourth Amendment rules can be tricky.

We do not yet know, for instance, what defense the Minneapolis officers in the killing of George Floyd will mount, but assuredly it will not be that the law was unclear.\nAdmittedly, part of the rationale for immunity is that public officials should not hesitate, because they fear being sued, to act in the public\u2019s interest. But don\u2019t we want officers to err on the side of avoiding force when there are alternatives? Don\u2019t we want them to resort to force, deadly or otherwise, not as a reflex triggered by muscle memory but as a trained choice on the use-of-force spectrum?\nLaw enforcement is under the microscope today. Recruitment of diverse officers and retention of seasoned detectives is harder than ever. In times like these, it is fair to ask, do we want to subject police to lawsuits and personal liability? This question implies, however, that we must cloak officers with the conceit that they operate with impunity to forge an effective police force.\nThis is exactly backward. Officers should know that they will be far better trained for tough situations, that they will have to make hard choices, and that we respect them enough to expect them to get it right.

Theirs was an improbable, decades-long friendship \u2014 a Catholic originalist and a Jewish feminist, a principled conservative and a pioneering liberal \u2014 that reflected the noblest vision of the nation\u2019s highest court, a shared commitment that one organ of American government stood above the banal tumult of politics.\nLast week, President Donald Trump had the temerity to doubt the dying words of Justice Ginsburg, relayed to the American people by her granddaughter. On Saturday, by announcing a nominee just weeks before the election, he disregarded and dishonored them.\nJustice Ginsburg\u2019s fervent last wish \u2014 to have her successor named by the next president \u2014 was not about preserving the Supreme Court\u2019s precarious political balance. It was a warning to a nation already on edge that appointing a justice on the eve of an acrimonious presidential election would drain the court of its public legitimacy and tear America apart. It would turn the judiciary into the one thing, particularly in this moment, it cannot afford to become: another polarized and nakedly political body.\nThe branch of government with neither an army nor the power to tax is only as strong as the people\u2019s faith in it.

Georgia in 1832, where the Supreme Court recognized the tribal sovereignty of the Cherokee Native Americans. President Andrew Jackson questioned the court\u2019s power to compel Georgia to comply with its ruling: \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\u201d The Trail of Tears followed.\nA century later, even after a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1952), the governor of Arkansas directed the state militia to block the schoolhouse doors so Black children could not attend Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight Eisenhower had to dispatch the 101st Airborne Division to enforce the court\u2019s rulings.\nThe progress we have made should not be taken for granted. Our country survived Bush v. Gore because of the trust we place in the court. Vice President Al Gore conceded the election, President George W. Bush took the oath, and the Republic endured.\nThis fragile trust has never been more at risk. Gone are the days when Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice Scalia, representing the far left and right flanks of the court, were unanimously confirmed on the strength of their qualifications. Today, serious people are talking about adding two to four seats to the nine-member Supreme Court, granting statehood to Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., and abolishing the filibuster, proposals that could stand on their merits but are being pitched as righteous retaliation as the President rushes to fill a vacancy even as ballots are being cast to replace him.\nThis race to the bottom has no end. Except that America returns to a grim time when the court\u2019s decisions were only as valid as the weight of public sentiment behind them.\nI would like to believe Justice Scalia would join his friend in urging our senators to extend the same courtesy to Justice Ginsburg that he was ultimately accorded, to have a successor confirmed only after the people have spoken. For he would understand that Justice Ginsburg\u2019s parting wish was never about her legacy, but about the legitimacy of the court.

But other potential charges are not necessarily barred, even today, because Maryland has not imposed time limits on certain felony crimes.\nFor example, attempting a sexual assault with the aid of another person counts as attempted first-degree rape, just as restricting a victim\u2019s breathing to stop her from shouting for help could fairly qualify as first-degree assault. Both are felonies with no statute of limitations in Maryland. Likewise, under Maryland law, using force to move a victim a short distance, even from one room to another, can amount to kidnapping, a crime that similarly has no limitations period. There are examples across the country where convictions for kidnapping have been upheld in cases where rapists took the victim just to a separate room to commit the crime.\nTo be sure, the allegations go back 35 years, to when the accomplished federal judge was a high school senior. What may or may not have taken place at a Bethesda home in the early 1980s would no doubt be hard to prove at trial and might not, in the judgment of local prosecutors, justify criminal charges all these years later.\nBut sexual assault prosecutions are always difficult to try, and decisions about whether to bring charges are properly made after, not before, an investigation is complete. Plus, here, Ford has already named a potential witness to the alleged attack, voluntarily subjected herself to a lie detector test and, in 2012, told others who could corroborate her account of what happened.\nJust as Ford deserves to have her allegations taken seriously, Kavanaugh is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But it is the responsibility of local authorities to investigate a credible criminal allegation to determine what happened. And it is not uncommon for police and prosecutors to pay closer attention in high-profile cases, even cold cases, when prominent individuals such as Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby are accused of crimes. That is partly to combat the impression that people with power get away with crimes when others do not, and partly to vindicate the wrongly accused if defamatory claims prove false.\nIn this case, an impartial investigation would not just be for the sake of the alleged victim; it would also be good for Kavanaugh and the integrity of the Supreme Court. The Senate, after all, will soon take a fateful vote in circumstances that have already placed the legitimacy of the court at risk, even before the latest revelations: This will be the first time in American history that a president at risk of impeachment and under criminal investigation will name a justice to the Supreme Court. Neither Bill Clinton nor Richard Nixon nor Andrew Johnson did that.\nThis is no time to push through a nominee without addressing the cloud of criminal uncertainty overhead. An expedited investigation confined to a short list of witnesses and this specific incident could, one way or the other, provide the resolution the Senate needs before it decides whether to confirm Kavanaugh.\nUnlike virtually every other act of government \u2014 from executive orders to congressional statutes \u2014 a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court is one of the few under our Constitution that cannot be undone except under the extraordinary circumstance of impeachment. One exquisitely American tenet the court affirms every day is that no one is above the law.\nFord, at great risk to herself, has put that to the test.

This month, interim Police Commissioner Gary Tuggle joined the chorus. He criticized Judge Jeffrey Geller for releasing on probation a defendant, Raytawn Benjamin, charged with illegal gun possession, who has also allegedly been linked to several gang-related murders.\nIt\u2019s a tempting strategy: firing at targets who, by oath and office, can\u2019t shoot back. It\u2019s a shrewd tactic used to support failed, regressive policies like mandatory minimums that resurface in times of crisis. It\u2019s also a false narrative that needs to be put to rest.\nPart of the problem is a common misconception of the role of judges when it comes to sentencing. Truth is, city judges decide what sentence to impose in a tiny fraction of cases.\nHere\u2019s the reality that many outside the justice system do not know:\nOnce a case is indicted by the grand jury, it can end in one of four ways. First, prosecutors could drop the case, a decision judges have no power to stop. Second, the case could result in an acquittal, where again there is no sentence for the judge to impose. Third, prosecutors could strike a plea deal with the defendant, which under Maryland law judges cannot influence \u2014 unless the prosecutor and defense counsel allow it. Finally, a jury could find the defendant guilty at trial.\nOnly in this last case \u2014 a conviction at trial \u2014 does a judge have actual authority to decide what prison sentence is warranted. But trial convictions are rare these days. The Baltimore Sun reported last year that \u201c(o)nly 17 percent of defendants who elected to go to trial were tried and convicted,\u201d which produced a startling total of only 175 trial convictions for an entire year in Baltimore. Sentences in those cases are the sole ones for which the public can fairly fault judges.\nThis is why I decided to take a closer look at the video in the troubling case of Raytawn Benjamin.\nTurns out, there\u2019s a lot more to the story, perhaps more than the commissioner knew.\nAs the Daily Record editorial advisory board pointed out last week, the sentence the judge ultimately chose was not far from the plea range proposed by the prosecutor and defense attorney. The prosecutor asked for 18 months; that meant, for a firearm charge where an inmate typically serves half the sentence because of the time he had already served, Benjamin would be out by summer.\nMoreover, the city judge knew almost none of the facts Tuggle identified as reasons for a stiffer penalty. The judge was never told that Benjamin had been linked to gangs or murders; that he had been shot twice; that incriminating evidence was recovered from his cellphone; or that, from prison, the defendant asked an associate to dispose of a gun used in numerous violent crimes.\nBenjamin\u2019s only other adult charge, also for a firearm, was dropped because the arresting officers were convicted on federal corruption charges.\nSure, Geller could have focused more on the defendant\u2019s prior juvenile commitments for firearms, which the prosecutor noted \u2014 or asked more, in a city besieged by retaliatory killings, about the recent murder of the defendant\u2019s mother, which the defense attorney referenced. But what Geller faced was one side asking him to sentence a 20-year-old with no adult convictions to a few more months in prison, while the other side asked the judge to send Benjamin home that day with no prospects and a felony record.\nInstead, Judge Geller picked up the phone, called Project Serve (a workforce development program with wraparound services led by Living Classrooms), and proposed Benjamin as a candidate. The defendant was required to return to court on Jan. 17 with an update. Neither the prosecutor nor the defense lawyer raised an objection.\nEveryone is fed up with unrelenting crime. Many will still disagree with the judge\u2019s decision, even with these additional facts and context. In this case and every other, there\u2019s room for improvement all around.

I remain confident that judges, including Geller, endeavor to do that every day.\nSun: Getting aerial surveillance off the ground in Baltimore\nAt a City Council hearing last week, advocates and opponents of aerial surveillance presented a false choice between privacy and public safety. Truth is, with a little creativity and compromise, Baltimore can have both.\nAerial surveillance consists of a Cessna prop plane flying in public airspace with a battery of cameras taking what amounts to wide angle, low-resolution video of a large swath of the city.\nThe company promoting this apparatus is wrong to expect the city to grant the police department \u2014 not exactly an institution brimming with public trust these days \u2014 a blank check to surveil the city whenever and for whatever reason it wants. Instead, Baltimore should limit the use of aerial footage to the investigation of serious crimes, require written judicial approval in those cases and provide for periodic community review.\nCitizens are understandably skeptical after the train wreck that prompted this debate last time around. In 2016, the police department got caught running a \u201cpilot\u201d that no elected official was apparently told about in advance.\nIt did not matter that the funding came from philanthropists who have also supported the ACLU and abolishing cash bail, the same benefactors who funded a Johns Hopkins public health initiative to deliver eyeglasses to thousands of city schoolchildren. The cloak of secrecy and how the program was discovered were too much for Baltimore to stomach.\nBut, with a fourth consecutive year of record violence, our city cannot afford to discard potentially good ideas just because they were badly presented.\nAerial surveillance could be a potent tool to solve violent crimes. Admittedly the raw footage alone is of modest value: it shows blurs of unrecognizable dots and rectangles, which happen to be people and cars, moving about the city. But investigators can follow a blur tied to a crime to determine where the subject came from and went. And when that dot or box passes a street camera at a particular time, police have an opportunity to get a closer look.\nThe tandem of aerial footage that traces the path of \u201cdots of interest\u201d coupled with a sprawling network of higher-resolution, ground cameras could significantly improve clearance and conviction rates.\nSimilar to body cameras, this new investigative tool could also make it easier to contest or verify the statements of law enforcement and would give defense attorneys a clear method to exonerate the innocent.\nAt the same time, this \u201ceye in the sky\u201d raises serious and unprecedented privacy concerns that must be addressed. Earlier this summer, in Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that police have to get a warrant if they want a significant interval of cell tower location data, even though a private company (the cellphone carrier) collected it.

Baltimore should, after all, periodically reevaluate whether the fiscal costs and privacy concerns are worth it.\nThis approach circumscribes the use of an untested innovation, it guarantees vital judicial oversight, and it allows the community to meaningfully audit the program to assess its overall value each year.\nIt also gives our city a promising new tactic at a time when current strategies are manifestly failing.\nSeattle Times: Deporting Dreamers is as cruel and unusual as it gets\nIf banishment from the greatest country in the world to a place they have never known is not punishment, then what on earth is?\nAs a growing number of lawsuits have recently said, rescinding DACA is unlawful. Promising to 800,000 Americans a moment of legitimacy only to then withdraw it on a whim violates equal protection, due process and federal-agency law. No one yet has filed, however, the intuitive claim that this is also incompatible with the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. After all, to deport immigrants raised in America since they were children for the supposed sins of their parents is the definition of cruel and unusual punishment \u2014 expelling a person to a country they do not know because of a decision they did not make is as spiteful as it is bizarre.\nSo why has this trenchant Eighth Amendment challenge not been part of the legal attack on the president\u2019s actions? The main reason is because deportation was long ago classified as civil, not criminal, and the constitutional shield against cruel and unusual punishment only applies to criminal penalties. But the civil designation of deportation hearings is tied to a 125-year-old Supreme Court decision whose moorings have become threadbare with the passage of time, as America\u2019s immigration apparatus has become more and more indistinguishable from our criminal armament.\nWhen the seminal case (Fong Yue Ting v. United States) was decided in 1893, it was the Treasury Department \u2014 not the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 that was charged with implementing immigration policy. Today, state and local police routinely investigate immigration violations alongside 6,500 federal agents.\nPresident Donald Trump has all but confirmed that immigration policy in America today is inseparable from the fight against crime. He infamously began his campaign smearing Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d who brought drugs and crime with them. He has inflamed anti-immigrant sentiment with a dedicated victim hotline and graphic tales of crimes committed by immigrants. And his administration blames them for rising crime and promises strict immigration controls as the antidote.\nThe president\u2019s rhetoric and policies extinguish what remains of the myth that deportation disputes are civil matters. Moreover, even though we generally limit certain constitutional rights to criminal cases, extending those protections to immigration proceedings for extreme constitutional violations is not without precedent. Evidence from illegal searches is generally permitted at deportation hearings, for example, but if the Fourth Amendment violation is \u201cegregious\u201d \u2014 for instance, in cases of patent racial profiling \u2014 the constitutional right springs back to life and the evidence is barred.\nSociety and precedent have changed considerably from the time when core safeguards like the Eighth Amendment were originally declared inapplicable to deportation decisions. And the president\u2019s recent actions provide the perfect occasion to update the law. This is not, however, just about clinically clarifying our constitutional jurisprudence \u2014 it\u2019s about acknowledging the reality of what deportation means for Dreamers today, as it hangs like the sword of Damocles over every aspect of their lives.\nImmigration enforcement has become the predicate and pretext for countless vehicle stops, searches, detentions, arrests and prosecutions.", "start_char_idx": 28067, "end_char_idx": 33298, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e19f537f-6ca6-4fd0-8346-27df743b6450": {"__data__": {"id_": "e19f537f-6ca6-4fd0-8346-27df743b6450", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e93a5633-e38d-4e07-88a4-38eb0bbbe125", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "5904ec188ebc0d18da626ab39603d9a436b5bf4636858d1bf9c2f5c5b93dc322", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b8c90fc-5f01-4334-bc22-dee6aec896b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "4e3911cde13446550854981bc63621b0e75b4e297b97d71247e865aaf884b1b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9b84ac9-08e5-4c24-9c48-edc4915d3fd2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "23a6c0594c15f2f28075a80734363d1379b58c80ac612a55088107b7cc9f60eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Moreover, even though we generally limit certain constitutional rights to criminal cases, extending those protections to immigration proceedings for extreme constitutional violations is not without precedent.

No one even bothers anymore to disguise the underlying xenophobia in economic terms or to pretend this is about students overstaying their visas.

The Constitution\u2019s safeguards, including the Eighth Amendment, were meant to prevent just this. To separate someone from friends and family and to end the life they have built in America \u2014 unthinkable consequences for the actions of another \u2014 are as cruel and unusual a punishment as one can conceive. To answer that deportation is not punishment is to rely on a technicality that time has made a fiction. If banishment from the greatest country in the world to a place they have never known is not punishment, then what on earth is?\nSun: Data show mandatory minimum sentences won't stop Baltimore\u2019s gun violence\nFaced with one of the worst crime surges in Baltimore's history, city lawmakers are grappling with proposals that would impose a one-year mandatory sentence for unlawfully possessing a firearm within 100 yards of certain public places, such as parks, schools and houses of worship. With more than 200 murders already this year, frustration among leaders in Baltimore is palpable, but their focus is misdirected. State law already prescribes harsher mandatory minimum penalties for most gun cases, and those have done little to end the horrific bloodshed our city has endured these past couple of years.\nPublic data extracted from the Maryland Judiciary Case Search, an online database of state court cases, yielded 3,733 Baltimore City Circuit Court gun-related cases filed by prosecutors between January 2015 and June 2017. In three out of four gun crimes \u2014 2,852 of 3,733 cases \u2014 prosecutors already wielded a five-year mandatory minimum because of the defendant's record or the nature of the charges; in other words, only a quarter of the gun cases do not already contain charges that carry a mandatory penalty. There is perhaps no better proof that mandatory penalties are not a panacea for crime than the fact that statutory minimums already exist, yet gun violence continues to soar.\nThe latest version of the City Council bill developed to address the carnage adds a mandatory one-year penalty for second offenses or situations in which the gun is tied to another crime. This risks diverting energy and resources from prosecuting ruthless gangs and unrepentant killers \u2014 violent repeat offenders \u2014 who require our undivided attention by shifting some of the focus to defendants with less serious conviction records, if any at all. It's a strategy that's also more likely to target younger, black citizens. In fact, of the 881 gun defendants in the data set whose cases do not already trigger a mandatory penalty, 96 percent are African-American; 63 percent were under 25 years old, 9 percent were minors, and none had felony convictions.\nThese are not the serial offenders believed to be driving the murder crisis unfolding in Baltimore today. To concentrate on them in the name of public safety threatens to consign more young black men to the revolving door of poverty and prison. At a time when Baltimore needs to heal divides and rebuild trust in its communities, proposals that echo the failed policies of the past are painful to hear. For many, mandatory minimums are synonymous with institutional and structural racism, 100-to-1 crack-cocaine sentencing disparities, racial profiling and the misguided, interminable war on drugs.

Gun violence is decimating our neighborhoods, and public outrage is long past due. But reflexively recycling the regressive strategies of the 1980s will not make us safer and only risks further erosion of public trust.\nIt is also inaccurate to claim, as some have, that judges are mainly responsible for gun defendants prematurely returning to the streets. Take a look at the just over 2,000 gun cases resolved since 2015 in which a five-year mandatory minimum sentence applied \u2014 some for felony firearm possession, some connected to drug trafficking and some used in violent crimes from robbery to murder. Nearly 40 percent of them were dropped by prosecutors or placed on the inactive \"stet\" docket; of the more than 270 that went to trial, almost two-thirds of them ended in an acquittal on all counts. According to this analysis, the outcomes were nearly as disappointing for the 700-plus resolved gun cases carrying no mandatory penalty: The State's Attorney's Office dropped or stetted 26 percent of those cases; only nine resulted in a conviction at trial.\nThe fact is the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office already has ample tools under Maryland law to address both first-time, as well as repeat, gun offenders, but they often don't get to use them. Overall, since 2015, prosecutors dropped or stetted 35 percent of all gun crimes an average of six months after they decided to indict them, and lost another 65 percent of those they took to trial. The judiciary cannot be blamed for cases that are dropped or lost at trial. And criticizing judges \u2014 who, by oath and office, generally cannot respond \u2014 is a dangerous national trend we should not fuel.\nThere certainly are instances where a sentence dictated by the legislature matches the appropriate sentence in an individual case. But sometimes a one-year prison sentence for illegal gun possession is too high, and categorically barring a judge from giving a first-time offender a second chance is unwise. Conversely, sometimes a one-year sentence is too low: In 2012, for example, a circuit court judge in Baltimore City appropriately sentenced a defendant convicted of gun possession charges to eight years in prison (the maximum available in that case), even though he had only one prior conviction for simple drug possession and no mandatories applied. This was after the city prosecutor who handled the case filed a detailed sentencing memorandum and presented substantial evidence of the defendant's likely participation in two prior homicides.\nThat is hard work, and prosecutorial resources are scarce. So mandatory penalties offer an inviting shortcut. Perhaps this is why senior officials from the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office for the past two years have testified forcefully before the General Assembly in favor of statewide mandatory minimum laws. In its advocacy for a 2016 state bill that would have imposed a mandatory minimum sentence for illegal gun possession for everyone, including those with no criminal record (the same as the original City Council bill), prosecutors lamented that Baltimore faced a \"new normal\" of 300-plus murders a year, explained that the \"profile of the offender\" in Baltimore City tended to be young men between 16 and 21, and stated that with respect to handgun violations \"the pendulum ha[d] swung too far\" toward an \"emphasis on treatment.\"\nThese kinds of arguments have been marshaled in support of mandatory minimums before. Over the past 40 years, however, at untold costs to communities of color, we have learned that mandatory minimums are not the answer. In 2017, that is not a lesson we should have to learn again.\nSun: The legal case against Trump's Muslim ban\nThe day after the United States bombed airfields in Syria to punish the Assad regime for the chemical slaughter of civilians, the Justice Department quietly filed its latest brief defending a ban on refugees from that country.

Next month, appeals courts on both coasts will debate the matter, hearing arguments in cases from Maryland and Hawaii, where two district judges found that a revised presidential order blocking immigrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries violates the Constitution.\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is scheduled to hear the Maryland case on May 8, recently announced that all 15 judges (instead of the usual three-judge panel) would review the lower court's decision. And President Donald Trump has already vowed to challenge the rulings \"all the way up to the Supreme Court.\" That may be where this dispute ends up, with a first test for Justice Antonin Scalia's successor Neil Gorsuch, but the president should not be surprised if it ends differently than he hopes. Especially considering that the Justice Department's main defense \u2014 that the words of the president are beyond review, and his campaign promises and divisive rhetoric can be disregarded after election day \u2014 is unsound as a matter of history, law and policy.\nFor the sake of democracy, a candidate's commitments on the campaign trail should not be forgotten or forgiven as the false promises and flamboyance needed to get elected. Candidates do not get a clean slate once they take the oath of office. As the federal judge in Maryland said, \"the world is not made new every morning.\" Politicians' pledges and proposals should be reliable indicators of how they intend to govern and lead. And what they say to score cheap political points lingers long after the smoke of a campaign clears.\nThe legal allure of the president's argument is its resemblance to a position Justice Scalia often advanced: Why on earth should a court get to see behind the curtain to understand the purpose of state action rather than look simply at the language of the law? According to Justice Scalia, the intent of the legislature must be divined from text alone, without regard to statements by its advocates on the legislative floor. That view, even skillfully framed by one of history's most gifted jurists, never fully took root. Now, President Trump's lawyers are trying to replant that defective seed in the context of executive action, where the concerns Justice Scalia raised are at their weakest.\nJustice Scalia, after all, was worried about problems specific to legislatures: the risk that shrewd legislators could poison the record with statements that do not reflect the true intent of the majority, the challenge of ascribing a single voice to a legislature composed of many different lawmakers, and the temptation to selectively pluck from a dense legislative history only those statements supporting a court's preferred ruling.\nBut none of those concerns apply when it is the president's words a court is weighing. For one thing, the president has no reason to sabotage his own orders by proclaiming an illicit motive that is not his own. For another, unlike the cacophony of a legislative chorus, the president sings with a single voice. So, Justice Scalia's fears of being unable to discern a unifying note are misplaced when one person speaks with the clarity and consistency that President Trump has on this subject.\nIndeed, federal judges in both cases now on appeal had no trouble identifying President Trump's intent from a string of unambiguous, unwavering statements made before \u2014 and after \u2014 he was elected, calling for the exclusion of Muslim immigrants. There was plenty to point to: his original rallying cry demanding a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" (November 2015); his clarification that his policy as the Republican nominee was not a \"rollback\" but an \"expansion\" of his earlier proposal (July 2016); his response as president-elect, \"You know my plans,\" when asked about the Muslim ban after an attack in Germany (December 2016); and, on the very day of the signing of the order, titled \"Protection of the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,\" President Trump remarked, \"We all know what that means\" (January 2017).\nYes, Mr. President, we do.

Asking courts to accept the pretext of fighting terrorism and ignore the president's true motive is just how states for too long prevented interracial marriage and denied marriage equality, how cities redlined neighborhoods by race and perpetuated segregated schools, and how the Supreme Court upheld Japanese internment camps in Korematsu v. United States and embraced the shameful doctrine of separate but equal in Plessy v. Ferguson.\nThankfully, that is not the law or tradition followed by courts today. Americans should be proud that our judges are no longer swayed by the veneer of neutrality and instead are compelled by the Constitution to ferret out sinister purposes that lie beneath the surface. These days, judges and juries routinely determine intent, from employment discrimination and racial gerrymandering to Fourth Amendment and Establishment Clause cases. That is all that the courts have done here, properly declining, as the Hawaii court wrote, to \"crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has.\"\nPresident or politician, words matter. They can be weapons too. And the harm of hateful words especially \u2014 the sense of inferiority and subordination they engender \u2014 cannot easily be undone. Nor can the damage to the hearts and minds of those whose faith the president has denounced be rectified by a clumsy, unconvincing pretext inked into an order by a clever lawyer's pen. Federal judges are not fooled by this. Neither are the rest of us.\nVox: A look at the past work of the Deputy AG who called for Comey\u2019s firing\nJeff Sessions\u2019s No. 2 was more moderate than his boss on a range of issues \u2014 and an effective crime-fighter.\nThe United States Senate just confirmed Rod Rosenstein as the country\u2019s Deputy Attorney General, ending his tenure as US Attorney for Maryland after a dozen years of distinguished service. The first order of business for Rosenstein may be briefing his new boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, on how Maryland reduced violent crime rates by 37 percent from 2005 to 2014 \u2014 because it was not by following the script that Sessions has been promoting.\nWhen it comes to fighting crime, Sessions seems to be dusting off the failed playbook of the 1980s. He is concerned that America has developed \u201ctoo much of a tolerance for drug use \u2014 psychologically, politically, morally.\u201d Because \u201clives are at stake,\u201d he recently said, he is \u201cnot going to worry about being fashionable.\u201d No risk of that. From hitting the brakes on police reform, to praising Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign, to stressing the supposed moral failings of drug users, the attorney general has signaled a return to the policies and rhetoric of zero tolerance, dragnet deportation, mandatory minimums, and mass incarceration as the backbone of the Justice Department\u2019s strategy to curb violent crime \u2014 which Sessions likes to say is on the rise.\nIn truth, crime nationally remains at historic lows. Unfortunately, some cities like Baltimore have seen a heartbreaking surge in murders and violence after years of steady progress. But that progress was not achieved by resorting to the tactics that Sessions appears to support.\nRosenstein enjoyed rare bipartisan support in Maryland and was the only United States attorney in the country appointed by President George W.

Unfortunately, some cities like Baltimore have seen a heartbreaking surge in murders and violence after years of steady progress. But that progress was not achieved by resorting to the tactics that Sessions appears to support.\nRosenstein enjoyed rare bipartisan support in Maryland and was the only United States attorney in the country appointed by President George W. Bush who remained in the role at the end of the Obama administration. This was no accident. Federal prosecutors who served in his office (Democrats like me among them) wrote in support of his confirmation, and local elected prosecutors from across Maryland sent the Senate a similar letter, reporting that when they ask Rosenstein for assistance, \u201che does not care if you are a \u2018D\u2019 or an \u2018R\u2019, he has only cared about making this State safer.\u201d\nAnd there he made real strides. Over his first decade as the lead federal prosecutor in Maryland, murders statewide were cut by a third, double the decline at the national level. Other violent offenses like robberies and aggravated assaults also fell faster than the national average, including a remarkable 70 percent drop in carjackings across the state. A few years ago, even in the stubborn conditions of Baltimore, Rosenstein \u2014 working shoulder-to-shoulder with law enforcement, state, and local prosecutors, and most important the community \u2014 saw bleak homicide numbers decrease to less than 200 for the first time in 33 years.\n\nA lot of folks deserve credit for that, as Rosenstein would be the first to point out. But he was a big part of it. Take, for example, the impact on the Cherry Hill community in South Baltimore, where there had been 35 shootings in one year soon after Rosenstein took office. In 2013, his office brought federal racketeering charges against 26 men responsible for numerous murders, shootings, and robberies. Afterward, the neighborhood went 700 days without a shooting.\nThat was tough, targeted enforcement, and it was typical of his tenure. Prosecutors helped drive down murder and violent crime rates by concentrating on gang leaders and gun violations, not by vilifying victims of addiction, getting tough on marijuana, or reviving policies of mass incarceration for petty offenses. Collaboration between prosecutors, police, and the community combined with a dogged focus on violent repeat offenders was the anchor of Rosenstein\u2019s approach.\nIn addition, reconceiving America\u2019s drug epidemic as a public health crisis, not solely as a problem of crime, has represented a massive step forward in policy and insight \u2014 one that Rosenstein embraced. Last year, in an editorial in the Baltimore Sun, he and Maryland\u2019s Attorney General Brian Frosh described the heroin and opioid epidemic as \u201cone of the most significant public health issues facing the nation.\u201d Even as they promised to seek stiffer penalties for dealers whose drugs led to overdose deaths, they also concluded: \u201cEnforcement efforts are more effective when they are part of a larger strategy to prevent addiction by educating potential drug abusers, and ensuring that help is available to people who become addicted.\u201d\nSessions does not seem convinced. Last month, at a youth summit, the attorney general talked up enforcement and appeared to disparage treatment, remarking that it \u201coften comes too late\u201d and that he had \u201cseen families spend all their savings and retirement money on treatment programs for their children, just to see these programs sometimes fail.\u201d Complete remission among victims of heroin addiction will never be 100 percent, but that has not stopped Rosenstein from appreciating the importance of treatment, particularly in the context of reentry programs.\nA year ago, Rosenstein visited a federal prison to talk with inmates about their future. He recognized that they \u201cface strong temptations to return to a life of crime\u201d and emphasized the programs available to help them, saying, \u201cOur mission is preventing crime, not just sending people to prison.\u201d Rosenstein hired a re-entry specialist and this past December published a statewide 181-page catalog of services for ex-offenders seeking a better life. The funds from the Justice Department that made this possible are now on a list of cuts Sessions reportedly wants to make.\nSessions has also blamed immigrants for everything from DUIs to rapes to gang murders, warning that \u201ccountless loved ones would not be grieving today if the policies of sanctuary jurisdictions were ended.\u201d But mass deportation is no better a strategy to identify and incapacitate violent criminals than mass incarceration was to fight the spread of drugs in America\u2019s inner cities.", "start_char_idx": 47918, "end_char_idx": 53041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34b1e8c6-9fbc-4350-9b99-3e1f18fe069a": {"__data__": {"id_": "34b1e8c6-9fbc-4350-9b99-3e1f18fe069a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e93a5633-e38d-4e07-88a4-38eb0bbbe125", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "5904ec188ebc0d18da626ab39603d9a436b5bf4636858d1bf9c2f5c5b93dc322", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "82af3498-3af1-4c04-90fa-67b0edc06b9e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "8df0cf911c417e78b13460f7bc96c57163605520a43ccd641b5e630ad79c3c50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "406ecaed-e519-4b90-aae4-77c4010b0ddd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "979d6a907de8504dc9e0e29262e82bea14596739174f03f584a95bdcb224fabc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A year ago, Rosenstein visited a federal prison to talk with inmates about their future.

Rosenstein seems to get that too. Following the directive of President Barack Obama to prioritize \u201cfelons, not families \u2026 criminals, not children,\u201d Rosenstein sparingly used federal immigration laws to target violent repeat offenders who were breezing through the state system.\nA prosecution of mine, for example, resulted in the incarceration of a domestic abuser for violating federal immigration law: He had twice entered the country unlawfully, twice attacked his victim, and twice pled guilty to assault. The second attack \u2014 where he started to beat and strangle his victim before throwing her to the ground \u2014 took place back in Baltimore just months after he had been deported.\nBeyond individual cases like this where special attention is warranted, Rosenstein has also consistently gone after whole organizations like MS-13, bringing his first indictment against 19 members of the vicious street gang in his first year as US Attorney and his last one just last month. He would notify immigration officials of criminal defendants who were in the country unlawfully. But his first priority was holding them accountable for the murders and violent crimes they committed in Maryland.\nNor did Rosenstein ever doubt the need to crack down on police misconduct. As US attorney, Rosenstein prosecuted individual cases of corrupt cops across the state. For years, he also pursued sweeping indictments that exposed systemic wrongdoing by law enforcement. They ranged from extortion charges in 2011 against city officers who, for a kickback, funneled accident victims to select towing operators, to a racketeering conspiracy in 2013 involving prison guards who were in bed with inmates (literally and figuratively). Currently pending are allegations against seven police officers accused of falsifying arrests and stealing money and drugs from arrestees.\nThanks to careful, painstaking investigations like these, Rosenstein has managed to preserve excellent relations with local law enforcement while at the same time bringing corrupt officials to justice. These cases also sent an important, unmistakable signal to the community that wearing a badge is not a license to break the law.\nNo one disputes that Rod Rosenstein is a rock-ribbed Republican. But he had an impact in Maryland using strategies and rhetoric very different from those Sessions has espoused. What has happened in Baltimore the past two years is wrenching and tragic, but the answer is not to disregard the lessons from the decade of progress Rosenstein embodied.\nThe attorney general would be wrong to sideline the very strategy that made his new deputy such a success. It would also dishonor the work of police and prosecutors at the state and federal level who toiled for a decade \u2014 led by dedicated public servants like Rosenstein \u2014 to prove that we can secure public safety without sacrificing our values.\nSun: Baltimore\u2019s rejection of maglev shows a lack of next generation thinking\nIn 1729, Baltimore held an advantage over every other American city \u2014 it boasted the westernmost deep-water port on the Eastern Seaboard.

The next generation\u2019s rail system \u2014 superconducting magnetic levitation trains that travel over 300 miles per hour \u2014 requires that kind of leadership.\nBaltimore currently lacks it.\nThis deficit of leadership was confirmed recently when city officials filed their formal objection to a maglev train to Washington, D.C., just one week after Amtrak executives testified against the project and pushed for more subsidies to expand their own legacy rail lines instead.\nBaltimore should not have succumbed to shortsighted lobbying or the false choice between Amtrak and maglev. At stake is a complementary transit proposal requiring no local tax dollars that promises to create thousands of jobs, slash regional commute times, reduce congestion and carbon emissions, and revitalize dwindling neighborhoods desperate for people and capital.\nFor a city losing 1% of its population each year, one surefire way to spark a surge in newcomers is to introduce a sleek, 15-minute bullet train between an increasingly unaffordable political capital and a port city with high vacancy rates. The rail line would continue further north in the future, ultimately taking commuters to the world\u2019s financial center, New York City, in 45 minutes. The herculean construction would generate 74,000 jobs and, once complete, remove 16 million car trips from the road each year.\nEven so, Baltimore\u2019s concerns about equity, affordability and the environment are legitimate. The job of city leaders, however, is not simply to spot problems but to solve them as well.\nTake gentrification. At greatest risk are proposed terminals like Cherry Hill, whose residents, after enduring the neighborhood\u2019s hardships for years, could be pushed out just as the renaissance arrives. But the solution is to stop displacement, not to resist development. Learning from mistakes elsewhere, Baltimore should pioneer a novel paradigm of growth without gentrification, attracting diverse new homeowners even as it persuades those who have fled to return and those who are here to remain.\nIn Cherry Hill, the city could cap annual property tax increases at inflation for existing homeowners, guarantee residential options in new developments for current public housing tenants, offer South Baltimore natives who moved to the suburbs incentives to return, and subject developers to the same affordable housing and mixed-use requirements that federal grant programs like Hope VI and Choice Neighborhoods impose.\nEcological concerns can likewise be addressed. According to the Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s impact assessment, every proposed route threatens Maryland\u2019s cherished Patuxent Wildlife Refuge. That\u2019s a deal-breaker. But the agency\u2019s analysis also says longer (albeit more expensive) stretches of deep underground tunneling could avoid these risks altogether.\nThat leaves one last objection: Only the rich can afford to pay an expected $60 for a one-way ticket on maglev. But that\u2019s the average price, and pre-purchased tickets could start at $27, already less than the current $46 Acela fare. High initial prices were also an objection to iPhones and airplanes. Fares on maglev and Amtrak will come down with time and competition. Plus, there are pricing regulations that could ensure affordability. An annual commuter pass could be capped, for example, at 5% of the rider\u2019s salary, making daily maglev travel cheaper for a line cook than a CEO. Baltimore could also issue income-dependent transit subsidies to people who elect to live in the city.\nWith some ingenuity and elbow grease, high-speed rail can be transformative, sustainable and fair.

History tells us there is no better place than Baltimore for the next chapter of rail travel to begin. We just need the courage and leadership to get on board.\nSun: A good day in Birdland\nMany of us spent last week lamenting the tragic football death of a promising Baltimore area native and the latest viral video depicting undeniable police brutality. Between those disturbing headlines and the daily drumbeat of crime stories, sunny images of our mayor zipping around on an electric scooter are hard to enjoy. But these days Baltimore has to savor its small victories. And Mayor Catherine Pugh\u2019s deal-making with two electric scooter companies is not only a win for city transit, it is also a reminder that decisive, even maverick leadership \u2014 on crime and so much else \u2014 can make a real difference.\nSoon to replace the disastrous Bike Share program are 2,000 dockless scooters promoted by two cool, entrepreneurial companies that have agreed to give discounts to low-income users and ensure that at least a quarter of their fleets serves mixed-income neighborhoods.\nNo doubt there will be critics with legitimate concerns: More of an opportunity for public input and greater transparency about the terms of the deal would have been appreciated, a clear plan to avoid them lying around like litter would be helpful, and above all the public needs confidence that the safety risks of electric scooters on city streets and sidewalks are understood and under control.\nBut the alacrity with which this was accomplished should also be applauded. There were no work groups or task forces, no hemming and hawing or self-destructive games of chicken. City Hall saw an opportunity and seized it. In a town whose transit deficits are as widespread as they are neglected, companies developing leapfrog technologies like electric scooters are a beacon of hope. Baltimore is in desperate need of a few overnight, starter solutions.\nTruth is, \u201cmicromobility\u201d options will help immensely with the stubborn last-mile problem, an actual and psychological obstacle that keeps so many Americans in their cars. And electric scooter companies like Bird and Lime promise to bring with them local, living-wage jobs \u2014 from repairmen to rechargers. To be clear, they won\u2019t make up for Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s indefensible disinvestment in the Red Line, and they can\u2019t patch the innumerable gaps in an inequitable, Swiss-cheese transportation grid that leaves too many resorting to selling drugs around the corner rather than commuting to a legitimate job two hours across town.\nStill, the mayor deserves credit in this case. To appreciate the audacity of City Hall inking this agreement, consider the allergic reactions of so many other cities. Several cities including Miami, Denver and San Francisco banned scooters soon after they arrived, and Milwaukee sued one electric scooter company when it refused to leave. In Nashville, Cleveland and Los Angeles, scooters have been impounded, tossed into the ocean, even set on fire. Places that saw a company to tax or a nuisance to avoid are missing out. For once Baltimore wisely saw promise in innovation where others perceived only pitfalls.\nIndeed, some of Baltimore\u2019s best moments have been when we act with urgency and when we lead rather than follow, breaking from the unimaginative blueprints of other cities. It was a year ago last week that Mayor Pugh had another defining moment, when she brought down Confederate statues without the needless discussion and debate that paralyzed and divided other cities. Odd as it is to relate the historic dismantling of symbols of hate and evil to swift negotiations with electric scooter companies, both were good days to remember in a city that has too few.\nPart of why the challenges of Baltimore appear so intractable is because true durable solutions require investments whose returns are years away. But appreciating the need for long-term strategies should not prevent us from taking decisive, short-term actions.\nAs a candidate for state\u2019s attorney, I often said fighting crime is both a marathon and a sprint. That is true for so many of our city\u2019s greatest problems. To be sure, electric scooters will no more solve the transit crisis in Baltimore than removing Confederate statues will end racism in America.

Mr. West has a prior federal felony conviction for which he spent nine years in prison. He was apprehended only after finally surrendering to police last week, three weeks after a murder warrant was issued for him.\nUnbelievably, the next day, Mr. West was home.\nThere is no excuse for the outrageous decision of a city judge to release a homicide defendant on electronic monitoring and a $100,000 bail. Prosecutors should have no trouble getting this dangerous error swiftly reversed.\nBut there\u2019s more here to set right than an isolated, errant judgment.\nAs a city prosecutor, I never saw a single case in which a person charged with first-degree murder was released on bail. Mr. West became the exception to the rule and went home on a bail more typical of a defendant charged with assault or resisting arrest, not murder, because he could afford to.\nHe hired one of Maryland\u2019s most expensive and effective defense attorneys, the kind of lawyer whose rates you pay to persuade a pliable district court judge to bend norms and do the unthinkable. And then Mr. West presumably forked over enough to a bail bondsman \u2014 likely around 10 percent of $100,000 \u2014 to read news of his arrest on Monday from his dining room table on Tuesday.\nIn federal court where I started my career, there is no cash bail. Mr. West exploited features of a predatory state industry that makes poor defendants charged with petty offenses languish in prison while rich perpetrators indicted on violent crimes pay and go home. This system survives in only two countries in the world: the United States and the Philippines, a regressive, authoritarian regime.\nUnder federal law, there is also a presumption against releasing a person charged with violent gun crimes. Defendants can overcome this presumption only by showing they are not a flight risk or a danger to the public. Maryland should adopt this same rule. It would prevent the impulsive release of defendants like Mr. West; it would curb the cash bail roulette wheel currently in operation; and instead of another round of finger pointing, it would convert public outcry into a practical improvement.\nBecause, if we\u2019re to be honest, this judge\u2019s casual treatment of a murder case is symptomatic of a far bigger problem: Violence has bled into the psyche of the city, death is becoming routine, and too many of our neighbors are losing hope that anything can be done.\nThis erosion of faith is not the fault of judges. Today, Baltimore has among the highest rates of murders and opioid overdose deaths in America with nearly 3,200 murders and over 3,900 fatal overdoses in the past dozen years. That\u2019s more than 7,000 people \u2014 1 percent of Baltimore\u2019s population \u2014 who lost their lives to guns or drugs, yet these tragedies rarely make the evening news or the front page of our papers anymore.\nWe should abolish cash bail and adopt the federal presumption against release in violent gun cases. But this will not erase the gnawing indifference or growing acceptance of crime produced by four consecutive years of relentless violence. For that, we need a sense of urgency and outrage to match the moment \u2014 and we need it now. Otherwise, a murder defendant released on bail will become the norm, not the exception.\nSun: For Baltimore archdiocese, release of grand jury report presents opportunity to atone\nAs lawmakers debate the Child Victims Act in Annapolis, a Baltimore City judge has agreed to publicly release \u2014 only after suitable redaction \u2014 a blockbuster report prepared by the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office cataloging 80 years of sexual abuse perpetrated by 158 priests and other officials affiliated with the Archdiocese of Baltimore.", "start_char_idx": 64075, "end_char_idx": 68900, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00efbd28-a6e0-4a5b-8abf-210748200ec8": {"__data__": {"id_": "00efbd28-a6e0-4a5b-8abf-210748200ec8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e93a5633-e38d-4e07-88a4-38eb0bbbe125", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "5904ec188ebc0d18da626ab39603d9a436b5bf4636858d1bf9c2f5c5b93dc322", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfbcdc75-d9ae-4b10-be2e-dd7be7bdac46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/aayushgupta/Mayor/virtual-avatar/data/txt/TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_name": "TV Op-Eds.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75279, "creation_date": "2024-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-26"}, "hash": "383dcccbc6a0171bef7e75cec9a9bc26fac2ef904e19639f74159fd6e8439fc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "46793680-cb49-48e6-848b-3a2fe4b68899", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "874f446d7cd4117f3fb57505082a2f626ad3574f343e9bc0c64ed0fe448248a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We should abolish cash bail and adopt the federal presumption against release in violent gun cases.

Releasing the report, the capstone of a grand jury inquiry that spanned four years and examined hundreds of thousands of internal documents, is exactly the right thing to do, morally and legally.\nTucked beneath its sanitized title, the 456-page \u201cClergy Abuse in Maryland\u201d is expected to chronicle a century of shame. According to the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the investigation \u201cuncovered pervasive sexual abuse amongst the priesthood and repeated failures by the Archdiocese to protect the children of Baltimore.\u201d In total, it identifies over 600 victims and predicts hundreds more.\nYet, the report spent months tied up in litigation over its public release. At first, Baltimore Archbishop William Lori said the Catholic Church would not oppose the report\u2019s distribution, signaling it was braced for a moment of reckoning. Soon after, however, it was revealed the archdiocese was privately paying two prominent attorneys who fought to seal the proceedings and the report itself, according to the Attorney General\u2019s Office, making it uncertain whether the findings would ever see the light of day.\nThe announcement Friday that a redacted version will be available for public review ends the standoff. The anticipated release shows respect for victims who have long fought to expose the Church\u2019s complicity in widespread abuse, encourages additional survivors to come forward now knowing they have a voice, and gives the archdiocese an opportunity to atone.\nWithholding the report in its entirety would serve only to protect perpetrators, fortifying the strategy of delay and culture of silence they created and counted on. It also would have been a clear misapplication of the law. The American grand jury conducts its work behind closed doors, but its conclusions are meant to be public and unedited. The veil of secrecy, designed to protect witnesses and preserve the integrity of ongoing proceedings, is supposed to be fully lifted once an investigation has run its course.\nIn criminal cases, that happens each time a grand jury returns an indictment. The same presumption of disclosure applies to investigative grand juries, which have produced eye-opening reports on topics nationwide, including homelessness in California, school safety in Florida and voter fraud in Illinois.\nGrand juries have proved potent in exposing institutional wrongdoing that amplified individual crimes. Take, for example, the 2011 investigation of Jerry Sandusky. That grand jury report not only laid bare the depravity of the disgraced football coach, but also excoriated Penn State for its failure to intervene. Several years later, a second grand jury criticized the university\u2019s inaction in the face of \u201crampant and pervasive\u201d hazing and condemned the role of influential alumni and affluent donors in resisting reform.\nLike Penn State, the Archdiocese of Baltimore \u2014 powerful, popular and politically connected \u2014 is an anchor in the community. Its footprint encompasses 153 parishes and missions, 40 elementary schools, 18 high schools, and 462 patient beds at two area hospitals. Baltimore was the first diocese in America, yet it remains today among the last to confront its shameful past.\nTwo decades ago, an investigative grand jury first put the spotlight on child sexual abuse within the Archdiocese of New York. Subsequent grand jury reports unmasked abuse by clergy and the Church\u2019s acquiescence in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania grand jury took a second look in 2018, generating a report similar in scope and scale to the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office investigation. That inquiry looked at six dioceses from Allentown to Pittsburgh and identified more than 300 \u201cpredatory priests\u201d whose rape and abuse victims over 70 years could number \u201cin the thousands.\u201d\nNone of these reports, not even Pennsylvania\u2019s incendiary tome, contained more than the bare minimum of redactions. The Baltimore archdiocese deserves the same.\nThat is especially true since, for many survivors of child sexual abuse in Maryland, an unvarnished public accounting of the truth may be the only justice they get.

Criminal prosecutions are vanishingly rare. Memories are fragile, victims are apprehensive, and in places like Baltimore \u2014 where the Catholic Church has the highest concentration of parishes in the state \u2014 police have competing priorities as the city exceeds 300 murders year after year.\nLikewise, civil relief is sharply circumscribed in Maryland. Though survivors do not typically disclose their childhood trauma until they are over 50, plaintiffs here can sue only until age 38, unlike 24 other states where child abuse claims may be revived. The General Assembly is considering a bill (H.B. 1) that would erase this constraint. But, even if passed, it would face a convoluted constitutional challenge because of a messy 2017 law backed by the Catholic Church, which the archdiocese now says irretrievably extinguished all older abuse claims.\nDespite the paucity of criminal and civil remedies, there may be no better time to reassure survivors that they are not alone and that their stories will not be edited, discredited or roundly ignored. Between \u201cThe Keepers\u201d (a Netflix documentary linking the unsolved 1969 murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik to sexual abuse allegations at a Baltimore Catholic school), the Attorney General\u2019s Office report, and potential new legislation, patience with the Church has worn thin, survivors have found strength in their shared horror, and the archdiocese faces a defining inflection point.\nPedophiles cloaked in the vestments of Catholic priests have done untold damage to thousands.
