The Baltimore Sun is preparing its online voter guide for the upcoming election. Please answer the following policy and political and education background questions below.

We ask that responses be submitted by end of day Friday, March 13 at the latest and each response be kept to 250 words or fewer. Answers will be published in the guide as-is, and will also be used as part of our endorsement process. The Sun's editorial board will not make endorsements in every race, but all answers will be posted online. 

Any questions, please let us know: kagordon@baltsun.com.
